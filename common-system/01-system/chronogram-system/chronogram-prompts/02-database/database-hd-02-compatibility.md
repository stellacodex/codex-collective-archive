Dream Relationships for Each Type in Human Design
Generators
* One where you have space to do what you love when you want to do it.
* One where you having the freedom to pursue what brings you joy is a top priority.
* One where you’re asked good questions about your passions and you feel inspired to share about them.
* One that honors your boundaries and doesn’t take advantage of your precious energy.
* One that reminds you to drop out of your mind into the knowing of your gut (and doesn’t ask you to explain your gut knowing).
* One that reminds you what deep satisfaction and fulfillment can feel like in a relationship.
So ask yourself: Which relationships bring you deep satisfaction and fulfillment? Who do you love talking about and doing things you love with?

Manifestors
* One that feels expansive.
* One that makes you feel free and powerful rather than small or constricted.
* One that encourages you to pursue your biggest dreams, even the ones that feel terrifying.
* One that doesn’t expect consistent energy from you.
* One that honors your natural capacity to lead while also stepping up to lead in all the times you need them to.
* One that fills you with peace.
* One that treats your need for time alone as sacred and doesn’t take it personally or make you wrong for it.
* One who doesn’t try to control, guide or sway you.
* One who knows what a gift it is to be provoked and transformed by you.
So ask yourself: Who brings you the most peace? Who inspires you to be bolder, bigger and more free?

Projectors
* One that reminds you what it feels like to be truly seen, in the deepest of ways.
* One who treats your perspective as gold and creates space for you to share your insights.
* One who treats your need for time alone as sacred and necessary.
* One who handles things when they notice you need to recharge.
* One who reminds you the more you honor the natural ebbs and flows of your energy, the more successful you’ll be.
* One who doesn’t expect you to operate like them and is curious about how you operate best.

* One that feels perfect for you right now.
* One where you aren’t expected to operate on any timeline beyond the one that feels right for you.
* One where you feel free to express however feels authentic and right for you in the moment.

* One that is always attuned to how a space makes you feel and prioritizes you feeling good wherever you are.
* One who is in awe of what a gift it is to be around you and access how you see the world.
* One that leaves you beautifully surprised.
So ask yourself: Who feels the best to be around? Who makes you feel treasured and cherished?

Manifesting Generators
* One that inspires you to pursue the things that have been lighting you up from the inside out.
* One that doesn’t make you explain why or how you do things, but is just captivated by and in love with your superhuman nature.
* One who honors your way of doing things, but doesn’t try to be the same.
* One who gives you space to make things happen in your own flow.
* One who doesn’t make you wrong for shifting direction or changing your mind.
* One that knows when you follow your gut, it’s the right decision for everyone.
* One that reminds you what deep satisfaction and fulfillment can feel like.
So ask yourself: Which relationships bring you deep satisfaction and fulfillment? Who honors what works best for you?


Human Design Relationship Connection Chart The Zen Femme

Compatibility Calcurator HUMDESCOM
￼
CAT FITZGERALD
There are a number of different ways we can look at compatibility in Human Design. My personal view on compatibility overall is that we can all be in a healthy relationship with anybody - all relationships come with their challenges and their ease. I don’t love the fearmongering that tends to happen around compatibility that says, “x type of person and x type of person will never work together, it will always be awful!” Pft. Anyway…
Some people believe that type for type is the best scenario in HD. I don’t really agree with that, because it depends so heavily upon how much each party is in their authentic self and how much they are in their not-self. Two Manifestors together could be really lovely…or, they could simply destroy each other. Etc.
We can look at profile resonance. 1st lines vibe well with 4th lines, 2nd with 5th, and 3rd with 6th. Therefore, the most harmonic profile combos for a couple would be: 6/2 and 3/5, 1/3 and 4/6, 2/5 and 5/2, 1/4 and 4/1, 2/4 and 5/1, 6/3 and 3/6. There is commonality here. Though the harmonic lines will be on a different journey, there is the ability to relate to each other. I myself don’t look to this a whole lot because there is a myriad of ways to be compatible and incompatible with someone, but I do think it’s worth mentioning.
For me, if we’re talking relational questions, I’m pulling up a connection chart. Here’s the connection chart for my husband and I as an example:

https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!kv6O!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ba9a328-12d2-4dd6-ad8b-0a0a0a8f6900_2168x1406.png

At the bottom lefthand corner, you’ll see a Connection Theme. Connection themes are formed by how many centers are defined and undefined when the two charts come together. Corey and I make 7-2, because together we have 7 defined centers and 2 undefined. Here are the descriptions for each connection theme:
￼
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONNECTION THEMES AND BREAKDOWN OF COMPOSITE CONFIGURATIONS

9 + 0 = No Where to Go 
- When together, no one else can get in; it can be very comfortable, and be hard to separate
from each other; which includes abusive relationships. Once you enter a 9+0 relationship - all your other relationships are no longer around, as they disappear (if entered correctly, then correct; if not entered correctly, then it is very problematic).
Also, if in this type of relationship, keep it as a couple and not add a third or more, as there is no space for the other. No one else can get in, you get locked into the relationship - healthy or not, depends on your awareness. Can't do anything about it
- If not meant to have it, then it was entered through conditioning, and can be very difficult. If correct, great, it's perfect.
See this a lot with couples who get together later in life

8 + 1 = Have Some Fun 
- One center being open is something you both can be open to, together, a common interest
that you can develop. It also provides a "single window" which gets you out of the relationship too. Inaddition, this window can be a platform to share and discover a different perspective. You join and are involved with each other through the open center, and can gain appreciation of each other. A healthy bond between people - considered the "best" scenario

7 + 2 = There's Work to Do 
- This dynamic can have the relationship end up in different interests, which can
ultimately send them apart from each other. Learn how to escape each other through their particular interests (not-self); the other side is that having a separate interest that is keeping them together, not separating them, giving them space to do what interests them separate from their partner; not trying to avoid them (avoiding is not-self), but embracing the difference. You have separate interest that are not separating - and can be healthy when aware

6 + 3 = Better to Be Free
- When correct, these people need their space, "freedom", and would come together for
whatever reason, to do what is correct for them to do and then separate again. But if entered via the not-self, this relationship can be a disaster - so many distractions and issues

5 + 4 = Out the Door/ A Relationship No More 
- Need a lot of space and freedom in this configuration. Could be
good for a couple that at least one travels a lot, and or for a couple of Manifestors that need their space. It is a relationship that you "get in" and "get out" and do your "thing", then move along in each person's separate ways
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Don’t be discouraged if you and your partner create one of the “less desirable” connection themes (7-2, 6-3, 5-4). Any relationship entered correctly via strategy and authority is correct, regardless of the theme you create. Having awareness of the potential challenges and strengths of your connection theme will do nothing but serve you. And, for what it’s worth, almost every significant relationship in my life creates 7-2, including my husband and my best friend of 20+ years.


You’ll notice also that underneath the chart, there are four different types of Connection Channels:
Compromise Channels - This is where one person has a full channel and the other person only has one of the gates in that channel. This can be tough energy to work with, because the person with the full channel is always going to be pulling the person who only has the gate, creating a sort of push-pull energy. With awareness, you can come to a space where you just kind of let each other be in these areas, and understand that you likely aren’t going to see eye to eye here and that’s okay. You can honor both of your energies.

Dominance Channels
 - This is where one person has a channel and the other person has openness. When together, the person with the channel with be naturally conditioning the person without it on an energetic level. The person with openness has a really cool opportunity here to experience energy that they otherwise do not have access to, and as long as they don’t try to force themselves to become The Best At It, they can enjoy exploring it while also admiring this quality in their beloved.

Companionship Channels
- This is when both people have the same channel. This is not energy that is attracting per se, because we are wired to seek diversity. This isn’t an exciting energy. What it can offer, though, is ease, stability, and an overall sense of comfort. You share the same strength and weaknesses in this area. While this won’t be the thing that attracts you to someone else, I feel that it can be super beneficial in a long-term connection.

Electromagnetic Channels
 - This is where each person has one gate on either side of a channel, and together they create the whole channel. This type of channel connection has an extremely intense magnetism to is, especially at first. You each want what the other has, and then you come together to create a new third thing. This can veer very much into the love/hate territory, depending on how both parties handle this energy. With each person having a different gate, you are both bringing very different energies and perspectives to the table. Can you respect the difference while also respecting the thing you create together? Or will the difference be one of those things where you loved that quality in them at first but now you hate it?

The last thing I’ll mention it looking at your two charts together to see where you might light each other up in terms of the nine centers. For example, if you look at our connection chart above, you’ll see that I have a defined solar plexus and my husband does not. Here’s an image labeling all the centers just in case:

￼https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZgFu!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b7d7216-44ae-476f-9972-f83bd8964887_1324x1712.png

The population is pretty much split 50/50 in terms of solar plexus definition, so it’s very likely that you are close to someone who has the opposite of what you have. Wherever we have openness in our chart, we take in the energy of those who have it defined and we amplify it. So, whenever Corey and I are together and in each other’s auras, I am conditioning him emotionally. What this looks like in real life is that I’ll be bopping around with a low level of casual annoyance at something - typically wholly unrelated to Corey and our relationship. He will feel that annoyance physically in his body, and if he is not very aware of his own emotional state before I come into the room, he might feel it, amplify it to anger, and think it belongs to him. The mind is also super great at picking a reason that the feeling actually does belong to him. So his mind could assign a reason to this false anger he’s now feeling, and then he might engage with me, and boom! Unnecessary fight.
So, you can see how rad it is to know where you might be conditioning each other via your respective definition.

Like I mentioned earlier, I believe that anybody can be with anybody. To me, the most important thing when it comes to relational dynamics is awareness. Human Design can really give us a great gift in this way. If we can understand how another is designed to show up in the world, perhaps we can have more compassion and grace for them, and perhaps they can do the same in turn for us. You can use the connection chart to check out your romantic relationships, your friendships, and your familial connections.
“You must love in such a way that the person you love feels free.”
― Thich Nhat Hanh

# Unique Human Design Unique Traits:
The five Human Design types have their unique needs in a relationship. Knowing what your partner needs from you allows you to understand how they function.

Manifestor (Initiator): Needs freedom and power. Needs to be informed. Needs support to manage anger. 

Generator (Alchemist): Needs to feel capable. Needs recognition and attention. Needs to be asked yes or no questions. Needs support to manage frustration. 

Manifesting Generator (Time Bender): Needs freedom, power, and capability. Needs to be asked yes or no questions. Needs support to manage frustration and anger. 

Projector (Orchestrator): Needs recognition and attention. Needs to feel precious and valuable. Needs help with bitterness. Needs to talk. 

Reflector(Calibator): Needs time, attention, and consistency. Needs to feel precious and valuable. Needs help to understand sensitivity. Needs support surrounding disappointment. 

Note: The names in brackets above are the Quantum Human Design (QHD) names for these Types. QHD helps us to reframe the ‘Not Self’ or conditioned self in Human Design to explore the potential of the deconditioned self and to live more in alignment with our inner truth.


# Relationships With Manifestors (Initiators)

Manifestors are powerful beings who are designed to create. They have an internal creative flow and when they want to do something- they do it. Manifestors are independent and subject to the whims of their creative flow. Non-manifestor’s natural impulse is to offer assistance or ask our Manifestor what they are up to. 

These questions can trigger an angry, or snappy, reply which can cause others to feel hurt or not needed. To combat this unintentional hurt, remember that it is not personal. Your Manifestor is not leaving you out on purpose! It takes a lot of energy for a Manifestor to stop and explain when they are in their flow. Stopping or simply pausing in their flow state is extremely uncomfortable for them which is what can trigger the snappy response. 

The Manifestor strategy of informing others will avoid a lot of tension in their relationships. Informing their partners of what they are about to do allows the partner to be prepared and stay out of their way so they can create. This act of informing can also tell the partner that this is a great time to pursue their interests outside of the relationship. 

What A Manifestor Wants and Intimacy With A Manifestor

If you love a Manifestor:

    - Wait for them to initiate (romantic relationships or otherwise)
    - Understand they don’t need anyone but they do want relationships
    - If they are angry it isn’t personal. Their creative flow likely got interrupted or things aren’t moving fast enough. 
    - Don’t ask them yes/no questions. Try “I’m wondering if…..
    - Be open to sexual suggestions because sex and intimacy is variable for them.
    - Just as they inform you; they also need to be informed.
    - Understand their need for downtime.
    - Give them freedom.
    - Honor their power.
    - Don’t tell them what to do
    - Don’t interrupt their flow.
    - Give them your trust. 



# Relationships with Manifesting Generators (Time Benders)

A partner who can truly do it all is the Manifesting Generator. Manifesting Generators are busy. They are intense multi-taskers filled with enormous bursts of energy who feel nothing ever moves fast enough. 

Manifesting Generators who use their energy, and follow their Sacral response, are a dynamic and powerful force that benefits relationships. They are committed and steady partners in the right relationships. 

When they are working, a Manifesting Generator prefers to be alone which can be very challenging for a relationship. From time to time, all Manifesting Generators will forget to inform others about what they are up to, leaving their partners confused, angry or even stressed about what might be going on in the relationship.

The outer frenetic appearance of the Manifesting Generator’s creativity can sometimes leave their loved ones feeling overwhelmed by their energy. Informing can help soften the intensity but the creative spark combined with the sustainability of the Sacral energy can feel like it’s too much at various times.

What A Manifesting Generator Wants and Intimacy With a Manifesting Generator 

If you love a Manifesting Generator:

    - Give them the freedom to go at their own speed and don’t try to keep up with them.
    - Don’t try to make them do one thing at a time. They are designed to multitask and skip steps. 
    - Just as they inform you; they also need to be informed. 
    - Don’t take their anger personally. It is how they learn.
    - Trust their sacral response.
    - Ask yes/no questions.
    - Don’t tell them what to do.
    - Don’t interrupt their flow.


# Relationships with Generators (Alchemists) Partners

Generators are designed to do the doing of life. They are designed to practice and practice until they achieve mastery. When Generators find something they love they are all in, but if they are not doing what they love they can become angry and depressed. 

Generator partners are fun-loving and always down for an adventure. 

What A Generator Wants and Intimacy With A Generator

If you love a Generator:

    - Don’t take their frustrations personally. Frustration is how they learn.
    - Understand how important their work is to them.
    - Help them get out of their heads and back into the world. 
    - Trust their sacral response.
    - Support and encourage their need to burn off energy. 
    - Ask yes/no questions. 


# Relationships with Projectors (Orchestrators)

Projectors do not have sustainable energy and are not meant to work in the traditional way we define work. For short periods of time, Projectors can amplify the energy of those around them and accomplish large amounts of work in short periods of time.  After these intense work sessions, they require a lot of alone time to recharge and rest. This can be challenging for energy types, like Generators and Manifesting Generators, who are constantly busy. 


A Projector partner needs to be recognized and invited in order to be seen and heard by their partners (and the rest of the world.) When not invited a Projector appears to be bossy and controlling which leads to aggravation from those around them. 


Projectors are wise and able to give great insight, and opinions, as long as you remember to ask for them. 


What A Projector Wants and Intimacy with a Projector 

If you love a Projector:
    - Recognize their intention is to be helpful – not controlling.
    - Recognize they are inherently wise and usually have valuable input.
    - Invite them to share their ideas with you.
    - Ask for their guidance and opinions.
    - Be open to sexual suggestions. Sex and intimacy is variable for them.
    - Intentionally give them your undivided attention and energy.
    - Provide a safe space for them to talk and for you to listen. 
    - Understand their need for downtime.
    - Value their insights and advice.
    - Be supportive. 



# Relationships with Reflectors (Calibrators)
Reflectors are a rare Human Design type. At only 1% of the population, a Reflector is designed to act like a mirror to the world around them. The reflection of other people continually changes their perception. One instant, you may feel extremely emotional, while the next moment, it’s gone. You may then get all the ideas and a sound sense of knowing where you’re going in life, and then it’s gone again, and so forth. That’s why it’s essential for you to carefully choose your friends and partners; they will have a huge impact on your feelings and experience of yourself.


Reflectors have considerably different life experiences than all of the other Types. Sometimes they may feel alone and misunderstood. Reflectors can also suffer deep disappointment when having to wait and live through the energy of others. This type of emotion causes Reflectors to require more attention than most other people (and Types). Because of this, at times they may feel inadequate and think that they don’t fit anywhere.


The most uncomfortable thing for Reflectors is pressure; especially the pressure to make decisions. Making a decision can be the most unnatural thing because Reflectors don’t necessarily make decisions.  They experience a choice or decision over a cycle of the Moon (29 days). It’s not the same as making a decision with the mind. Reflectors have to experience their choice inside of themselves over time. Going through the entire cycle gives them the power to be able to realize solutions and right choices.


Reflectors need people because they are non-energy beings and depend on the energetic connections that others provide them. But, they also need their alone time so that they may discharge energy that they’ve absorbed through the nine Open Centers.


What A Reflector Wants and Intimacy with A Reflector 

If you love a Reflector:
    - Love them as they are; don’t try to change them. 
    - Allow them to manage their energy without additional pressure.
    - Give them space and time.
    - Honor their need for long decision-making cycles.
    - Provide a safe space for them to talk and for you to listen. 
    - Be open to their sexuality. Sex and intimacy is variable for them,
    - Know that you will see the truth about yourself reflected through them and be okay with this revelation. 
    - Encourage and support daily energy-clearing practices.
    - Understand their need for downtime. 


# Relationship Compatibility List:
-Manifestor and Manifestor Relationship Compatibility
Manifestors are in this world to get stuff done. When two manifestors enter a relationship together they can become a true power couple ready to work together, or they just might get on each other’s nerves because each one thinks they have the better idea. Relationships between two people of the same Human Design type does come with an advantage because there is a shared understanding of how their type functions. If both Manifestors follow their strategy of informing others of what they plan to do they will be on the road to success. 

-Manifestor and Manifesting Generator Relationship Compatibility
Manifestors and Manifesting Generators are similar in regard to their energy levels. The difference is that Manifestors are marathon runners and Manifesting Generators are sprinters. The Manifestor can see the greater picture and work toward long-term goals while the Manifesting Generator sees the more immediate needs of the relationship. The Manifestor will probably get annoyed with their Manifesting Generator because they will view their bursts of energy as flaky or inconsistent. 

-Manifestor and Generator Relationship Compatibility
Manifestors are not designed to carry out their ideas. They are designed to be inspired but for others to carry out their inspirations. A Manifestor and a Generator work well together because the Generator has the slow and steady energy needed for consistent work and are here to put plans into action. 
Generators are more social than Manifestors and may struggle with the Manifestor’s need for alone time. Not everything needs to be done together and the Generator needs to remember that it is not personal, it is just the Manifestoes repelling aura at play. 

-Manifestor and Projector Relationship Compatibility
Human Design types can be split into two groups, those with consistent access to energy and those without. Manifestors and Projectors do not have consistent access to energy and require time to recharge their batteries. In order to recharge, both the Manifestor and the Projector need time alone, whether this is sleeping separately or spending time apart.  This alone time can develop a healthy sense of trust in a relationship because they are independent from each other while still maintaining their bond. 
Manifestors are often perceived by others as flaky or chaotic because of their tendency to follow their in-the-moment inspirations.  Because Projectors have a unique ability to see the greater picture they are a good match to the Manifestor.  Manifestors are also a good anchor for Projectors who have a tendency to feel they are too much or too sensitive for others. 

-Manifestor and Reflector Relationship Compatibility
Manifestors comprise about 8% of the population while Reflectors occupy a mere 1%. When Manifestors and Reflectors are in a relationship together they should be cautious of trying to match each other’s energies. A Manifestor can be perceived as domineering or pushy which could cause the Reflector to try to match their forceful energy. Conversely, the Reflector’s sensitivity, and need for consistency, could cause the Manifestor to try to water their energy down for the Reflector. 
Manifestors are the only Human Design type that does not have to wait before they take action- only to inform those around them of what they are doing. A Reflector may struggle with the Manifestor’s seemingly random inspirations and need for independence. 
This is not to say a Manifestor and a Reflector cannot be successful together. Only that they must remember to play to each other’s strengths. 

-Manifesting Generator and Manifesting Generator Relationship Compatibility
When two Manifesting Generators come together, they each bring high energy. Manifesting Generators have the ability to multitask and bounce from idea to idea which can lead to an element of controlled chaos. A blessing for Manifesting Generators in a relationship is that they both understand how their unique energy type functions in the world. This understanding is a huge advantage because Manifesting Generators can be misinterpreted as flaky or irresponsible due to their unfinished projects. 
Manifesting Generators in a relationship makes for adventure.  These couples need outlets for their energy, so make plans together to burn off the excess. 

-Manifesting Generator and Generator Relationship Compatibility
Manifesting Generators are a hybrid of Manifestors and Generators. Because the Manifesting Generator is partially a Generator there is an understanding of how each other functions. Generators are slow and steady in getting work done with consistent access to energy. Manifestors have access to energy that expresses itself in intense bursts. 
The constant flow of energy in this relationship can be very exciting but remember to keep an eye on the future plans and don’t get sidetracked by the in-the-moment inspirations. The Generator is going to want to act on the Manifesting Generators ideas but not all ideas are meant to be carried out. 

-Manifesting Generator and Projector Relationship Compatibility
Manifesting Generators tend to focus on the present moment. Projectors think about the long-term or big picture. Together a Manifesting Generator and a Projector can create a well-balanced relationship. With strong communication, the Projector can be reminded to have some in-the-moment fun while the Manifesting Generator is reminded to pause and consider the future. 

-Manifesting Generator and Reflector Relationship Compatibility
Reflectors are designed to reflect their environment and because of how Reflectors absorb energy they need space and time to discharge that energy.  In a relationship with a Manifesting Generator, the Reflector can access some of the high energy and excitement of the Manifesting Generator. While the Manifesting Generator can find calm and healing in the reflector. 

-Generator and Generator Relationship Compatibility
Generators make up about 35% of the population, so chances are they will end up in a relationship with each other. This partnership has a unique energy balance that can keep up with each other and participate in a variety of joint adventures. A challenge for Generator couples is boredom so ensure you both are a part of planning and participating in your outings. 

-Generator and Projector Relationship Compatibility
Generators are designed to do all the things, but Projectors work at a slower pace. Both of these types have the ability to see the bigger picture but the Projector can narrow everything down while the Generator can pinpoint the specific things that are in need of a response. Generators have access to their energy at all times, while the Projector needs time to rest and recharge.
A Projector in a relationship with a Generator is going to feel pressure to keep up and inevitably feel guilty when they can’t. A Generator may get frustrated and not understand their Projectors need for time alone to rest and recharge. This relationship needs lots of communication about understanding to ensure success. 

-Generator and Reflector Relationship Compatibility
Generators and Reflectors can work very well together. The Reflector acts as a guide for the Generator’s never-ending stream of work and projects. Generators need to remember to step back from their work and have fun sometimes and the Reflector can bring that playful energy to the relationship. After the fun is had the Reflector will need alone time to recharge, and the Generator can hop right back into their work. The busy Generator needs to remember that their Reflector needs their alone time and it is never personal. 

-Projector and Projector Relationship Compatibility
A Projector and Projector relationship has no secrets. The deep and penetrating aura of the Projector allows them to see each other for who they really are. On one side this can be a healthy and understanding relationship but can turn toxic – creating a co-dependent bond. 
Projectors meet each other with intensity and can skip over the time they need to develop trust. For this relationship to last both Projectors need to engage in personal development and honest communication. 

-Projector and Reflector Relationship Compatibility
Reflectors are not fazed by the Projectors penetrating aura. In fact, a Reflector can act as a guide for the Projector. The Reflector is designed to help humanity and the Projector is designed to see the big picture, so these two together are capable of great things. This relationship is low-energy so be careful that you both have time to rest and recharge so you can accomplish those great things before you both burnout. 

-Reflector and Reflector Relationship Compatibility
The rarest of all Human Design relationships would be two Reflectors. Reflectors are mirrors so this couple would reflect each other. Interestingly enough, two reflectors together can create defined centers which form a new identity for the couple. Reflectors in a relationship can learn a lot about themselves as they experience their reflections. 



# What To Do When Your Human Design Types Clash In Your Relationships


As always, there is no suffering in Human Design – only opportunities for growth. For example, many challenges arise between high-energy types and low-energy types. A Generator (has access to sacral energy) and a Projector (does not have access to sacral energy) couple can be an amazing partnership when they both understand each other’s unique needs. 


The Generator needs to have interests that function without the Projector so that the Projector can rest and recharge alone. If the partners do not understand each other’s energy needs, the Projector could try to keep up with their Generator leading to burnout and bitterness; while the Generator views the Projector as lazy or unmotivated leading to frustration. 


Areas, where the types are different, can cause clashes, but only when partners are not informed about their needs and the needs of their partner. If you are experiencing challenges in your relationship, it might be a good idea to revisit your charts and learn more about how you both are designed. 


# Communication Within Human Design – Helping Your Partner Feel Seen And Heard 
Our needs in relationships are our energetic needs. The Centers in our chart tell us a lot about how we communicate with the world around us and the types of needs we have. If you have open centers, they absorb the energy from those around us. Creating predictable behavior patterns and mistaken motivations in relationships. Knowing your partner’s open centers can help you communicate with them effectively. 

-Open Throat Center 
If you have an open Throat Center you need extra support with attention and recognition. You can not be heard until you are recognized and you will find yourself attracted to people who give you attention. Open throats can develop ineffective strategies in order to get attention. They might create drama or do things that are inappropriate to gain recognition from those around them. 

-Open G-Centers
Open G-Centers have a tendency to question their lovability. Open G-Centers might compromise their values in order to feel accepted and loved. Similar to the open G-Center, the open Will Center questions their value and self-worth. You will try to prove that you are valuable until you recognize your inherent value.

-Open Sacral Centers (Manifestors, Projectors, and Reflectors)
Open Sacral Centers (Manifestors, Projectors, and Reflectors) need alone time. They need help knowing when enough is enough and support around not working in the traditional manner. If you are in a partnership with someone who has an open Sacral you need open and honest communication surrounding money, time, and rest to avoid conflict. 

-Open Root and Open Head Centers
Open Root and Open Head Centers feel pressure to meet their partner’s needs, even when the partner hasn’t asked for anything. It can be helpful to examine that pressure because you are placing burdens on yourself that can lead to bitterness and even resentment. 

-Open Solar Plexus 
Open Solar Plexus wants everyone to get along and will leave their needs unmet in order to meet the needs of others. 


# Intimacy Codes
In addition to our Centers, our Profiles have an impact on how we view, or experience intimacy. We are all hard-wired differently. Even the way in which we are hard-wired for some of our most basic needs is different. Not everyone is intimate or sexual in the same way. Misunderstandings and miscommunications surrounding intimacy can cause huge challenges. When you understand your intimacy code and your partner’s intimacy code, it can explain a lot!

Your chart contains a code for how you get your needs for intimacy, sensuality and sexuality met. Obviously, this code doesn’t explain everything and because your chart is a synthesis of many different elements, you have to know how to synthesize all the parts of the chart to get the full picture of who you are and what you need.

But the intimacy codes of the Profile Lines tell us a lot about your unique bonding strategy. Some codes are more compatible than others. Simply put, intimacy comes easier for some couples than others. Other couples have to work harder at it.

- Line 1 – The Resource
You need time to explore your partner. You are driven to build a deep foundation of intimacy in your relationship and that drive is often experienced as curiosity.

- Line 2 – The Responder
You need alone time with your partner (and sometimes away from your partner) to stay engaged in an intimate way. Your drive is the need for time and retreat (alone and together) to strengthen the bonds of your partnership.

- Line 3 – The Explorer
You need the freedom to fantasize about different ways to be intimate – and even the freedom to explore these fantasies in a way that is mutually consensual – in order to deepen your commitment to your partner.

- Line 4 – The Stabilizer
Friendship and trust are the foundation for you when it comes to intimacy. You need to know that you can trust your partner and the foundation of your friendship in order to be more intimate. You need stability and consistency.

- Line 5 – The Visionary Leader
To be truly intimate you need to cultivate the courage to be vulnerable. You’re pretty good at hiding and learning how to reveal your true needs and feel seen by your partner is essential for you to feel comfortable with genuine intimacy.

- Line 6 – The Adept
You long for a soulmate connection. The shadow side of this longing is that you might think that the “soul mate” connection is instant. It’s vital for you to realize that soulmate-level intimacy is often cultivated and curated by first learning to communicate honestly about what you need.


# Tips For Utilizing Human Design In Your Relationships
How to use Human Design for successful relationships:

    - Honor your unique type, strategy, and authority. 
    - Honor your partner’s type, strategy, and authority. 
    - Establish open and honest communication that allows each partner to feel seen and heard. 
    - Educate yourself on your and your partner’s profile’s intimacy code. 
    - Remember that your Human Design is a guide and anything that feels like a challenge is an opportunity for growth. 


# Compatibility By Human Design: Connection Themes, Channels & Profiles

- Compromise Channels
One person has a whole channel activated, and the other has only one gate. Such compromise creates a sort of pull/push energy, making a person with the channel pull the other one into their energy. These are very different energies by nature.
How to work with it. The key for a person with just one gate active is to understand that their design works differently and not “give in” to the energy of the person with the whole channel, as it will never feel aligned for them. Setting healthy boundaries, giving each other space, compromising intentionally, and accepting that the other person is not “just like you” in these aspects. So as Ra Uru Hu suggested, assuming a position of “agree to disagree” is the best approach.
It is also essential to understand that the dynamics here are mechanical. There is nothing one can do to change them. And there will always be a need to compromise in these relationships. It will not always feel suitable for the person with just one gate, as they get conditioned and affected by this energy, but they cannot change it. The only thing we can do is gain awareness about its presence and mechanics. It is not about the person. These are just these things.

Ra’s example (from “How We Connect”)
“For example, the 22nd gate is the gate of the left ear, the gate of listening. Very often, it’s about listening to music or poetry. It has romantic tendencies. For example, here is this couple, and 12 over here (Mr. Wonderful) says,’ I want to listen to blah blah. And 12 over here (Miss Wonderful), the one who has the full channel, says, `I’m going to listen to whatever I want to. Now they don’t necessarily say it that way. The fact is that no matter how the argument will go, in compromise it always leads to arguments. 
Not only that, in this case, if you had someone who was unemotional and she is emotional the moment he would want to listen to something that she doesn’t want to listen to, he would get the emotional wave, at which point he would say `Yes, dear, whatever, you like.’ It’s a mechanic. It’s just a mechanism. It’s not like it’s her fault because, truly, it is NOT her fault. It’s nothing to do with fault or blame. You cannot fault her ancestors or her whole genetic history because this is what she is – she has the whole channel. You can’t blame him. He doesn’t know any better. It’s like every time he wants to go down that road, somebody is trying to control how he gets to the end of it, and it begins to chew at him. This is a compromise. So many relationships have compromise in the construct, sometimes several in the construct. 
Relationships are extraordinary things when you get to that place where you can just let go and accept somebody’s design. Compromise in relationships for the mind is one of those annoying things, and it never stops being annoying to the mind. Because the mind enjoys digging into those things and trying to use them as mechanisms to take control. I understand the helplessness of the other. It mirrors mine. All I can do is embrace what’s there with awareness.”

妥協チャネル
1 人の人はチャネル全体がアクティブで、もう 1 人はゲートが 1 つしかありません。このような妥協は、一種のプル/プッシュ エネルギーを生み出し、チャネルを持つ人がもう 1 人の人を自分のエネルギーに引き込みます。これらは本質的に非常に異なるエネルギーです。
対処方法。ゲートが 1 つだけアクティブな人にとって重要なのは、自分の設計が異なって機能することを理解し、チャネル全体を持つ人のエネルギーに「屈服」しないことです。そうしないと、その人にとって調和しているとは決して感じられません。健全な境界を設定し、お互いにスペースを与え、意図的に妥協し、これらの側面で相手が「自分と同じ」ではないことを受け入れます。したがって、Ra Uru Hu が示唆したように、「意見の相違を認める」という立場を取ることが最善のアプローチです。
ここでのダイナミクスは機械的であることを理解することも不可欠です。それらを変えることはできません。そして、これらの関係では常に妥協が必要になります。ゲートが 1 つだけの人にとっては、このエネルギーによって条件付けされ影響を受けるため、常に適切であると感じられるとは限りませんが、それを変えることはできません。私たちにできるのは、その存在と仕組みについて認識を深めることだけです。それは人に関することではありません。これらはただの事柄です。
ラーの例（「How We Connect」より）
「たとえば、22番目の門は左耳の門、つまり聞く門です。多くの場合、それは音楽や詩を聞くことです。ロマンチックな傾向があります。たとえば、ここにこのカップルがいて、こちら側の12番（ミスター・ワンダフル）が「私は何々を聞きたい」と言います。そして、こちら側の12番（ミス・ワンダフル）は、完全なチャネルを持っているので、「私は何でも聞きたいものを聞くつもりです」と言います。ただし、彼らは必ずしもそのように言うわけではありません。実際のところ、議論がどのように進むかに関係なく、妥協すると必ず議論につながります。それだけでなく、この場合、感情的でない人がいて、その人が感情的だった場合、その人が聞きたくないものを聞きたくなった瞬間、彼は感情の波に乗れるでしょう。その時点で彼は「ああ、愛しい人、好きなようにして」と言うでしょう。それは仕組みです。単なるメカニズムです。それは彼女のせいではありません。なぜなら、本当にそれは彼女のせいではないからです。それは過ちや非難とは関係ありません。彼女の先祖や遺伝的歴史全体を責めることはできません。なぜなら、それが彼女だからです。彼女にはすべての経路があるのです。彼を責めることはできません。彼はそれ以上のことを知りません。まるで、彼がその道を進みたいと思うたびに、誰かが彼がどうやってその道を終えるかをコントロールしようとしていて、それが彼を悩ませ始めているようです。これは妥協です。多くの関係には構造上の妥協があり、時には構造の中に複数の妥協があります。

関係は、ただ手放して誰かのデザインを受け入れることができる場所に到達したとき、素晴らしいものになります。人間関係における妥協は、心にとって厄介なことの一つであり、決して心を悩ませ続ける。なぜなら、心はそうしたことを掘り下げて、それを支配するための手段として利用しようとするからだ。私は相手の無力さを理解している。それは私の無力さを映し出している。私にできるのは、そこにあるものを意識的に受け入れることだけだ。」


- Dominance Channels
One person has a full channel, and the other has none. All of a sudden, the second person takes in and experiences specific frequencies through this channel, and even more, he starts to start amplifying them. You get a sense of them and identify with them in a very specific way. They are being conditioned by the one with the channel. It is a great opportunity to learn from each other and about each other because you experience this energy consistently in the connection.
How to work with it. The person with the channel can assume the position of the leader in these relationships. It is a way of “lending” this specific energy to the other. The healthiest approach is to watch and celebrate the different energies that the dominant channels bring without making it into a conflict.

For example, my second husband Les had the 43/23 Channel of Structuring, and it is a lot about thinking all the time and downloading insights, but those insights can only make sense to others if articulated clearly and also spoken at the right timing – or when invited to share. One of the darker sides to this channel is that he was very bad at listening. He got too caught up in his own thinking process that he tuned out, only to turn around to me after a while and say or ask something completely off topic. It used to drive me NUTS. And I noticed that in his presence, I often did that same thing: tuned out when he and my daughter had chats over coffee. I used to think it was the topic of the discussion that put me off, but I suspect that I was actually being conditioned by this energy, and my tuning out (which interestingly does not happen that often with other people) is turning into a “thing” when I was with him. I just started thinking about something so deeply I lost track of the conversation.
This is how Human Design “saved my marriage” so to speak.  The marriage was very loving, but this gave me an extra level of awareness around things that if my Non-Self was in charge, I would have probably already divorced him ten times over this one fault alone.
NOW I am kidding.

支配チャネル
1 人は完全なチャネルを持ち、もう 1 人はチャネルを持っていません。突然、2 人目はこのチャネルを通じて特定の周波数を吸収して体験し、さらにそれを増幅し始めます。あなたはそれらを非常に特定の方法で感じ、それらと同一視します。それらはチャネルを持つ人によって条件付けられています。接続中にこのエネルギーを一貫して体験するため、お互いから、そしてお互いについて学ぶ絶好の機会です。
それをどう扱うか。チャネルを持つ人は、これらの関係においてリーダーの立場をとることができます。これは、この特定のエネルギーを他の人に「貸す」方法です。最も健康的なアプローチは、支配的なチャネルがもたらすさまざまなエネルギーを衝突にすることなく観察し、称賛することです。
たとえば、私の 2 番目の夫であるレスは、43/23 の構造化チャネルを持っていました。これは常に考え、洞察をダウンロードすることに関するものですが、それらの洞察は、明確に表現され、適切なタイミングで、または共有するように求められたときに話された場合にのみ、他の人に理解できます。このチャネルの暗い側面の 1 つは、彼が聞くのがとても下手だったことです。彼は自分の思考プロセスに夢中になりすぎて、耳を傾けなくなり、しばらくして私のほうを向いて、まったく話題から外れたことを言ったり質問したりしました。私はそのことで頭がおかしくなりそうでした。そして、彼がいると、私もよく同じことをしていることに気づきました。彼と娘がコーヒーを飲みながらおしゃべりしているときに、耳を傾けなくなったのです。以前は、会話の話題が私をうんざりさせたのだと思っていましたが、実はこのエネルギーに条件付けされていて、彼と一緒にいるときは、私の耳を傾けないこと (興味深いことに、他の人とはあまり起こらないことですが) が「物事」になっているのではないかと思います。私は何かについて深く考え始め、会話についていけなくなってしまいました。
これが、いわばヒューマン デザインが「私の結婚生活を救った」方法です。結婚生活はとても愛情深いものでしたが、これによって、もし私の非自己が主導権を握っていたら、この 1 つの欠点だけでおそらくすでに 10 回離婚していたであろうことについて、物事に対する意識がさらに高まりました。
これは冗談です。
 
- Companionship (Friendship) Channels
Both people have the same channel defined. You would think it is a perfect scenario, yet it is not that exciting. There are no “energetic attractions” here. Both people are the same. Same gifts. Same shadows. It is not something that is interesting to you because, genetically, we seek diversity, but this is a very deep connection that can offer “the safe place in a storm” – the safety and security on the deep foundational level.
But the other side is indeed boredom. It is not stimulating. It is the same thing.
 
交友関係（友情）チャネル
2 人とも同じチャネルが定義されています。完璧なシナリオだと思うかもしれませんが、それほどエキサイティングではありません。ここには「エネルギー的な魅力」はありません。2 人とも同じです。同じ才能。同じ影。遺伝的に私たちは多様性を求めているので、これはあなたにとって興味深いものではありませんが、これは「嵐の中の安全な場所」を提供できる非常に深いつながりであり、深い基礎レベルでの安全性と安心感です。
しかし、反対側には確かに退屈があります。刺激的ではありません。同じことです。


- Electromagnetic Channels (Attraction & Repulsion)
One person has a gate on one side, and the other has a gate on the other side of that same channel. Each is missing what the other has. They are always interested in what the other has, but when they meet, a new sort of “wiring” between the two centers happens.
It is an ever-fluctuating “attraction and repulsion” energy. It jumps back and forth. Love/hate relationships, have you ever been in one? I have! Making up, breaking up, happy to be together, hate being together, cannot be apart, glad to be apart. It is intense. Do you know what is worse? Having a relationship like this with a client. I also know it firsthand… Those were the times when I couldn’t afford even to think about the whole “ideal clients” concept. Or so I felt at the time.
How to work with it. The electromagnetic connection is very strong and can be very powerful in a relationship. The key here is again to understand the electromagnetic channels in the connection and what potential specific issues or enjoyment they bring.
As you can see, AWARENESS is everything. Let me now move to the juicy part- the connection themes. There are four themes, and I will go through all of them. “They are basic, but like all simple things, they carry a tremendous amount of truth”, says Ra.
One more very important thing to understand about these electro-magnetic themes is that it is not about the theme of a gate, or a channel. It is just one tiny tiny aspect of the gate theme, but it is persistently that microscopic theme that comes up.
In 1997, I was dating this guy with whom we have so many electromagnetic channels in our connection chart. The relationships went from hot to cold to hot again. There were specific themes around the hot and the cold switches. And in 2023, I met him again after 25 years, and we spent a day together. It felt so amazingly familiar and HOT. The day after, something happened in our chat, and we had a massive row (I do not even have rows with people in my life). The row felt so painfully familiar again.
But this time, with my awareness of our Human Design and connections, it was fascinating for me to observe the mechanics. It had nothing to do with us as people, our communication, or anything we wanted from each other. It was pure energy interaction at play. And it was exactly the same as before. The funniest thing was seeing my daughter roll her eyes EXACTLY like any of my friends in the 90s did when they learnt about another “break up” I had with this guy. There you go – energy/auric interactions at play, and nothing we can do about it. By the way, four weeks later, he reached out to me on WhatsApp as if the row never happened. And that is exactly what happened within the TWO YEARS we dated on and off! Ha!

電磁チャネル（引き寄せと反発）
一人の人間には片側にゲートがあり、もう一人には同じチャネルの反対側にゲートがあります。それぞれが、相手が持っているものを失っています。彼らは常に相手が持っているものに興味を持っていますが、彼らが出会うと、2つのセンターの間に新しい種類の「配線」が起こります。
それは常に変動する「引き寄せと反発」のエネルギーです。それは前後に飛びます。愛憎関係、あなたはそのような関係に陥ったことがありますか？私はあります！仲直り、別れ、一緒にいて幸せ、一緒にいるのが嫌、離れられない、離れられて嬉しい。それは強烈です。何がもっと悪いか知っていますか？クライアントとこのような関係になることです。私もそれを直接知っています...それは「理想的なクライアント」という概念全体について考える余裕さえなかった時代でした。少なくとも当時はそう感じていました。
それに対処する方法。電磁気的なつながりは非常に強く、関係において非常に強力になる可能性があります。ここでも重要なのは、接続における電磁チャネルと、それがもたらす潜在的な特定の問題や楽しみを理解することです。

ご覧のとおり、意識がすべてです。では、興味深い部分、つまり接続テーマに移りましょう。 4 つのテーマがあり、それらすべてについて説明します。 「それらは基本的なものですが、すべての単純なものと同様に、膨大な量の真実を運びます」と Ra は言います。
これらの電磁テーマについて理解する必要があるもう 1 つの非常に重要なことは、ゲートやチャネルのテーマではないということです。 これはゲート テーマのほんの小さな側面にすぎませんが、常に浮かび上がる微視的なテーマです。

1997 年、私は接続チャートに非常に多くの電磁チャネルがある男性と付き合っていました。 関係は熱から冷、そして再び熱へと変わりました。 熱と冷のスイッチの周りには特定のテーマがありました。 そして 2023 年、私は 25 年ぶりに彼と再会し、一緒に 1 日を過ごしました。 とても親しみやすく、ホットな気分でした。その翌日、チャットで何かが起こり、私たちは大喧嘩をしました（私は人生で人と喧嘩したことすらありません）。その喧嘩は、またしても痛いほど馴染み深いものでした。
しかし今回は、私たちのヒューマン デザインとつながりを認識していたので、その仕組みを観察するのは私にとって興味深いものでした。それは、私たち人間やコミュニケーション、あるいはお互いに望んでいることとはまったく関係ありませんでした。それは純粋なエネルギーの相互作用でした。そしてそれは以前とまったく同じでした。一番おかしかったのは、私の娘が、90 年代の友人たちがこの男性と私がまた「別れた」ことを知ったときとまったく同じように目を丸くしたのを見たことです。そうです、エネルギー/オーラの相互作用が働いており、私たちには何もできません。ところで、4 週間後、彼は喧嘩などなかったかのように WhatsApp で私に連絡してきました。そして、それはまさに、私たちが付き合ったり別れたりを繰り返した 2 年間に起こったことです！ハッ！

 
# Connection Theme 
- 9-0: Nowhere To Go
￼
The connection theme on the sample graphic above is the one called “Nowhere to go,” and it means the connection activates all 9 centers. This creates very strong bonding energy. It can be extremely wonderful. Or it can be extremely uncomfortable. This is why entering such a relationship correctly (following your Strategy & Authority) is so key. When these two people are together, there is no place for anyone else in this intimate relationship. They complete each other.
Now, if this is an abusive relationship, it can go very wrong, and it happens a lot out there. They are stuck, and they just cannot leave. They get locked into each other. THERE’S NOWHERE TO GO.
When I looked at connection charts with all my favourite clients, I discovered each one of our connection themes was 9-0. Perhaps this is because I have been following my Splenic Authority and entering these relationships correctly.
Now, the story. I have had this connection theme with clients, and yes, it felt good to be together on calls.
But I also recently had this connection in my romantic life. A few months after my second husband, Les, passed away, I wanted to start meeting new friends. For a loner like me who has no social life whatsoever, it is almost impossible to meet new people through your existing network. Thankfully, I do not have a 4th line in my profile (I am a 1/3), so meeting complete strangers is not an issue for me and the correctness of them. I have my Projector strategy and Authority for that. So, I joined Tinder.
The very first conversation I had was with someone who kind of stood out in the initial swipe fest the day before. I was not looking for love or even physical relationships. I frankly just wanted to get out of the house as I live alone. So, an occasional coffee with someone new and interesting. But this person felt very different. We hit it off in the chat and met a few days later. There was a very strong connection that stirred up a lot of anxiety in me, because, frankly, after 20 years of relationships, anyone would feel scared and “rusty”.
And yet, this person and I were meant to connect. We both entered the relationships correctly. I (a Projector) became visible and set my expectations in my Tinder bio. He (a Generator) responded and initiated the conversation. He was leading, inviting me deeper into the connection. My Spleen felt the sweetness and correctness of this invitation.
When I ran our connection chart, we had a 9-0 connection theme and a single definition, which means the energy flow is uninterrupted.

My anxiety with our meetings, understandable after such a massive loss just six months prior, was so tremendous. But what was much more profound was the feeling of total and complete peace and relaxation the moment when this guy and I came together, and became intimate. I couldn’t believe it. It was like the world stopped, and all my worries disappeared. And I was able to be totally in the moment with him, fully connected. Nothing else existed.
Now, this is not to be read into!!! This was just a mechanical feeling of this connection theme. “Nowhere to go,” totally locked on each other, fully flowing together harmoniously. His energy and my energy are completely intertwined. Some call this experience twin flames… Some call it Tantric. I see that all it is was this 9-0 connection theme.
The reality was far less romantic. The guy was not emotionally available, nor did he want to be. He had a very complicated story with his family and an ex-girlfriend in another country, the details of which I am not fully aware. But after the first week, he told me the ex and him were talking about reconciliation.  And yet, we both felt it was impossible to say NO to seeing each other. So we continued, and it was divine every rare time. I do not know if I have had such an experience with another human being ever before. NOT LOVE, just that energy completely locked into each other. Nothing else existed.
I went back on Tinder to find other people to start escaping this energy pull.  The theme of a love triangle is also recurring in my life, usually in the form of an ex. But I thought I might as well “drive” this and perhaps just continue having an affair with him while seeing other people. I was making any excuse to stay together in any capacity…
As I met some Tinder candidates where the chemistry was running high, I felt I couldn’t see two people at the same time and one night, we both reached out at the same time, trying to break this madness that we had off. He decided to reconcile with his ex. I was meeting someone whose chats were so promising…
Two days later, we were back in the chat discussing our no-strings-attached, “Freelove” affair – we were so hooked on each other we both experienced withdrawals, even though there was no real love or any future. Just this energy connection.
I swear, I never felt so tied in. It started feeling really painful and out of control, even though, thankfully, our schedules had prevented us from meeting for a couple of weeks by then.
Meanwhile, someone else matched me on Tinder, and this was something so different (a true karmic connection as it turned out later). I started to desperately want to sever that 9-0 energetic cord bounding me so powerfully.  As the new connection grew in depth and after I met this new person, I reached out and broke the affair off completely.
I cannot put into words HOW painful that breakup was to me. It was almost, ALMOST the same intensity of grief I felt earlier this year when I lost someone whom I considered my other half… And yet this stranger I spent three short evenings with was so painful to say goodbye to.
And I know this guy has been feeling exactly the same because we have had a very open and honest communication. Still, it was probably one of the most painful decisions I had to make in my personal life. It hurt deeply and felt impossible to execute.
This is the thing about this 9-0 connection. You have a complete flow (if you do not have a split definition in your connection chart) – and you literally get so locked in on each other, that there is no room for anyone else. It feels amazing, and so complete. And yet, if this is not a correct relationship – either by Human Design, or simply, like in my case, not at this point in either of our lives OR, like it can happen to be an abusive relationship, leaving it requires a titanic effort that some people do not have mental, emotional and spiritual power to make.
Another big, big lesson – the energy connection is NOT a guarantee for your relationships to be perfect. At all. It is just Human Design mechanics, and if you do not follow your Strategy and Authority to make decisions that are CORRECT for you (no matter how exciting or painful they can be). 
 
つながりのテーマ 9-0: 行き場がない
上のサンプル グラフィックにあるつながりのテーマは「行き場がない」というテーマで、つながりが 9 つのセンターすべてを活性化することを意味します。これにより、非常に強い絆のエネルギーが生まれます。非常に素晴らしいこともあれば、非常に不快なこともあります。だからこそ、このような関係に正しく (戦略と権威に従って) 入ることが非常に重要です。この 2 人が一緒にいると、この親密な関係に他の誰も入る余地はありません。彼らはお互いを補完します。
さて、これが虐待的な関係である場合、それは非常に悪い方向に進む可能性があり、それはよく起こります。彼らは行き詰まっていて、離れることができません。彼らはお互いに縛られてしまいます。行き場がないのです。
お気に入りのクライアント全員とのつながりチャートを見たとき、私たちのつながりのテーマはすべて 9-0 であることがわかりました。おそらくこれは、私が脾臓の権威に従ってこれらの関係に正しく入ってきたからでしょう。
さて、話です。私はクライアントとこのつながりのテーマを持っていましたが、確かに、電話で一緒にいるのは気持ちが良かったです。
しかし、最近、恋愛関係でもこのつながりがありました。2 番目の夫であるレスが亡くなってから数か月後、新しい友達に会いたいと思いました。まったく社交生活のない私のような孤独な人間にとって、既存のネットワークを通じて新しい人に出会うことはほぼ不可能です。ありがたいことに、私のプロフィールには 4 行目はありません (私は 1/3 です)。そのため、まったく知らない人に会うことは私にとって問題ではなく、その正確さも問題ではありません。私にはそのためのプロジェクター戦略と権限があります。そこで、Tinder に参加しました。

私が最初に会話したのは、前日の最初のスワイプ フェストで目立っていた人との会話でした。私は愛を求めていたわけではなく、肉体関係を求めていたわけでもありません。率直に言って、私は一人暮らしなので、家から出たいだけだったのです。だから、新しくて興味深い人とたまにコーヒーを飲みたいと思っていました。しかし、この人は非常に違った感じでした。私たちはチャットで意気投合し、数日後に会いました。非常に強いつながりがあり、それが私の中で大きな不安を引き起こしました。率直に言って、20年間の関係の後では、誰でも怖くて「錆びついている」と感じるからです。
それでも、この人と私はつながる運命でした。私たちは両方とも、正しい関係に入りました。私（プロジェクター）は目立つようになり、Tinderのプロフィールで期待を設定しました。彼（ジェネレーター）は応答し、会話を開始しました。彼がリードし、つながりの深みに私を招待しました。私の脾臓は、この招待の甘さと正しさを感じました。
私たちのつながりチャートを実行したとき、私たちのつながりのテーマは9-0で、定義は1つでした。つまり、エネルギーの流れが途切れないということです。
わずか6か月前に大きな喪失を経験した後では当然ですが、会うことに対する不安は非常に大きかったです。しかし、それよりはるかに深遠だったのは、この男性と私が一緒になり、親密になった瞬間に感じた、完全に平和でリラックスした気持ちでした。信じられませんでした。まるで世界が止まり、すべての心配事が消えたようでした。そして、私は彼と一緒にその瞬間に完全に身を置き、完全につながることができました。他には何も存在しませんでした。

さて、これは深読みしてはいけません!!! これは、このつながりのテーマの単なる機械的な感覚でした。「どこにも行けない」、完全にお互いにロックされ、完全に調和して一緒に流れています。彼のエネルギーと私のエネルギーは完全に絡み合っています。この経験をツインフレームと呼ぶ人もいます...タントラと呼ぶ人もいます。私はそれがすべてこの9-0のつながりのテーマであることを理解しています。
現実ははるかにロマンチックではありませんでした。その男は感情的にオープンではなく、そうしたいとも思っていませんでした。彼は家族や別の国にいる元ガールフレンドと非常に複雑な話を持っていましたが、その詳細は私が完全には知りません。しかし、最初の1週間後、彼は元彼と和解について話し合っていると私に言いました。それでも、私たちはお互いに会うことにノーと言うことは不可能だと感じました。それで私たちは続けました、そしてそれはめったにない機会のたびに神々しいものでした。これまでに他の人間とそのような経験をしたことがあるかどうかわかりません。愛ではなく、ただ完全にお互いにロックされたエネルギーです。他には何も存在しませんでした。
私はこのエネルギーの引き寄せから逃れるために他の人を見つけるためにTinderに戻りました。三角関係というテーマも、私の人生で繰り返し現れます。たいていは元カレの形で。でも、私はこれを「運転」して、他の人と会いながら彼との浮気を続けるのもいいかなと思いました。どんな形であれ、一緒にいるための言い訳をしていました…
Tinder で相性の良い相手と出会ったとき、2 人と同時に会うのは無理だと感じました。ある夜、私たちは 2 人とも同時に連絡を取り、この狂気を断ち切ろうとしました。彼は元カレと仲直りすることに決めました。私は、チャットでとても期待が持てる人と会っていました…
2 日後、私たちはチャットに戻り、束縛のない「フリーラブ」な関係について話していました。私たちはお互いに夢中になりすぎて、本当の愛も未来もないのに、2 人とも禁断症状を経験しました。ただエネルギーのつながりがあるだけです。
誓って、こんなにも縛られていると感じたことはありませんでした。ありがたいことに、その頃にはスケジュールの都合で 2 週間ほど会えていなかったにもかかわらず、本当に辛くて手に負えない感じがし始めました。その間に、別の人がTinderで私とマッチしたのですが、これはまったく違うものでした（後に本当のカルマのつながりであることが判明しました）。私は、自分を強力に結びつけていた9-0のエネルギーのコードを必死に切断し始めました。新しいつながりが深まり、この新しい人と出会った後、私は手を差し伸べて関係を完全に断ち切りました。
あの別れが私にとってどれほど辛かったか、言葉では言い表せません。それは、今年初めに自分のもう半分だと思っていた人を失ったときに感じた悲しみとほぼ同じくらいの強さでした…それでも、短い3晩を一緒に過ごしたこの見知らぬ人に別れを告げるのはとても辛かったです。
そして、私たちはとてもオープンで正直なコミュニケーションをとっていたので、この男性もまったく同じ気持ちだったとわかっています。それでも、それはおそらく私生活で私がしなければならなかった最も辛い決断の1つでした。それは深く傷つき、実行不可能に思えました。
これがこの9-0のつながりのことです。完全な流れが生まれます (接続チャートに分割定義がない場合)。文字通りお互いに完全に縛られ、他の誰も入る余地がありません。素晴らしい、そして完全な気分です。しかし、これが正しい関係でない場合 (ヒューマン デザインによる場合、または単に私の場合のように、私たちのどちらの人生のこの時点でもそうでない場合、または虐待的な関係である場合など)、それを離れるには、一部の人には精神的、感情的、精神的な力がない、途方もない努力が必要です。
もう 1 つの大きな教訓は、エネルギー接続は、関係が完璧であることを保証するものではありません。まったく。それは単なるヒューマン デザインのメカニズムであり、戦略と権限に従わずに、自分にとって正しい決定を下す場合 (それがどれほど刺激的で苦痛であっても)。


- 8-1: Have Some Fun
￼
This is the formula where 8 of the centers are activated, but there is one open center that is open on both charts, and that center is where the two of these people can be open to – together. They can develop areas of common interest, do things together, and discover the world together. This is a very healthy kind of bond between two beings.
I have to mention the correctness of entering any relationship again is key. Two of the clients with that I did not feel good over time had this bond with me, but it was only fun temporarily. Perhaps we had a lot of electromagnetic drama going on, but I know for a fact that I went against my Splenic impression in both cases, and I regretted it for years after. 
But this also makes me think about what Ra mentions about the splits between the definition: “it’s a mechanical thing. If the splits are there in the relationship, it means there are aspects of the way in which you connect to each other that do not connect to each other. It’s going to represent certain dynamics for the relationship that are going to cause tension.” And if the relationships are not entered correctly, there will be this disconnect that both are bound to feel at times. Or even all the time. Without understanding why and assuming it is the fault of the other person. Yet it is again just mechanics. How to work with it. The only way to deal with it is to surrender and accept that no fixing is required – you just choose to experience this relationship as is or leave. 
I have no dramatic story about this connection chart from my romantic life. None of my longer term partners or people I met while knowing and observing their Design and our Connection Theme fell into this one. So this is something we can still explore.  No theme is good or bad. It is just what it is.

8-1: 楽しむ
￼これは、8 つのセンターがアクティブになるフォーミュラですが、両方のチャートで開いている 1 つのオープン センターがあり、そのセンターは、これらの 2 人が一緒にオープンになれる場所です。彼らは共通の関心分野を開発し、一緒に物事を行い、一緒に世界を発見することができます。これは、2 人の存在の間の非常に健康的な種類の絆です。
私は、再び関係に入ることの正しさが鍵であることを言及する必要があります。時間の経過とともに気分が良くなかったクライアントのうち 2 人は、私とこの絆を持っていましたが、それは一時的な楽しみだけでした。おそらく、電磁気的なドラマがたくさん起こっていたのでしょうが、どちらの場合も、私は脾臓の印象に反していたことは事実であり、その後何年も後悔しました。
しかし、これはまた、定義間の分裂について Ra が言及していることについても考えさせます。「それは機械的なものです。関係に分裂がある場合、それは、お互いにつながる方法に、お互いにつながらない側面があることを意味します。それは、緊張を引き起こす関係の特定のダイナミクスを表します。」そして、関係が正しく入力されていない場合、両方が時々感じるこの断絶があります。または常に。理由を理解せずに、それが相手のせいであると想定します。しかし、これもまた単なるメカニズムです。それにどう対処するか。それに対処する唯一の方法は、降伏して、修正する必要がないことを受け入れることです。この関係をそのまま経験するか、去ることを選択するだけです。私の恋愛生活から、この接続チャートに関する劇的な話はありません。私の長期的なパートナーや、デザインと私たちの接続テーマを知り、観察しながら出会った人々は誰も、これに当てはまりませんでした。したがって、これは私たちがまだ探求できるものです。テーマに良いも悪いもありません。それはただそれであるだけです。


- 7-2: Work To Do
￼
This is an interesting formula because the 7 connected centers are forming a single definition, they do feel complete, but the two open centers mean that there is a possibility for the two different interests to form, where the presence of the partner is not only needed, but sometimes completely unnecessary. This is a kind of relationship that needs more space. It is important to understand the different interests of your partner, and a little break can actually be very healthy. When I have a client with a 7-2 connection, I make sure that I do not undermine a different direction that may attract them, but maybe for me, this seems like a waste of time or just “not my thing” to be strategizing with them in that area. I learned that being transparent and allowing that flexibility is great for these relationships. 
The need for space and having two centers open, might also mean that when the two partners need to escape each other, those escapes may be different for them. One will drown themselves in work, and the other will be leaning into their separate social life, for example. 
As I am typing this, I am entering a very interesting relationship where this is the connection theme and a single definition.  So far, I can say that the single definition in the connection chart means even more than the actual theme. It is especially palpable when we are together, and the energy just flows, the decisions seem to be so simple to make, and our communication flows openly and effortlessly. There are no cracks that are obvious. I think this theme will show itself in the everyday “living together” scenario, where there is often an escape from the relationships that is imminent for short periods of time, and then we will have two open centres (will and emotional in my case) that we will be escaping into, and not necessarily together and at the same time. Again, this is theory, and I have no story yet to report, as I am diving into this experience and drawing my insights in hindsight as usual. 
I always mention that I am a lone wolf. A 1/3 – very introspective, plus a Projector who needs space and time alone to flash the excess of the sacral overflow, this kind of relationship feels more healthy for me, as long as I observe where are those escapes and, again, try not to fix anything, just accepting and allowing it to be.
 
7-2: やるべき仕事
これは興味深い公式です。7 つの接続されたセンターが 1 つの定義を形成し、完全に感じられますが、2 つのオープン センターは、2 つの異なる関心が形成される可能性があることを意味し、パートナーの存在は必要なだけでなく、時にはまったく必要ありません。これは、より多くのスペースを必要とする種類の関係です。パートナーの異なる関心を理解することが重要であり、少し休憩することは実際には非常に健康的です。7-2 接続を持つクライアントがいる場合、私は彼らを惹きつける可能性のある別の方向性を損なわないようにしていますが、おそらく私にとっては、その分野で彼らと戦略を立てるのは時間の無駄、または単に「私のやり方ではない」ように思われます。透明性を保ち、その柔軟性を認めることは、これらの関係にとって素晴らしいことだと学びました。
スペースが必要であり、2 つのセンターが開いているということは、2 人のパートナーがお互いに逃げる必要があるときに、それらの逃げ方が彼らにとって異なる可能性があることも意味します。たとえば、一方が仕事に没頭し、もう一方がそれぞれの社会生活に傾倒するなどです。
これを書いている今、私はこれがつながりのテーマであり、単一の定義である非常に興味深い関係に入りつつあります。これまでのところ、つながりチャートの単一の定義は、実際のテーマよりもさらに意味があると言えます。私たちが一緒にいるとき、エネルギーがただ流れ、決定が非常に簡単になるようで、私たちのコミュニケーションはオープンで楽に流れているとき、それは特に明白です。明らかな亀裂はありません。このテーマは、日常の「同棲」シナリオで現れると思います。そのシナリオでは、関係から短期間で逃げ出すことがしばしばあり、その後、必ずしも一緒に同時に逃げるわけではない2つのオープンセンター（私の場合は意志と感情）があります。繰り返しますが、これは理論であり、私はまだこの経験に飛び込んで、いつものように後から洞察を引き出しているので、報告する話はありません。
私はいつも、自分が一匹狼だと言っています。 1/3 - 非常に内省的で、仙骨の溢れ出るものをフラッシュするために一人の空間と時間を必要とするプロジェクター。この種の関係は、どこに逃げ道があるのか​​を観察し、また、何も修正せず、ただ受け入れてあるがままにしておく限り、私にとってはより健康的だと感じます。


- 6-3: Better To Be Free
￼
These theme names are hilarious because this is my connection to both my first and second husbands, and my daughter Chantelle. So no, this does not mean we hate each other or we are not connected. The bonds between us have always been superbly strong, but the relationship works much better when we give each other plenty of space. I worked in one room all day, hubby in the other on the opposite side of the building. We’d meet up in the evening and party! Perfect.
When entered correctly, this is such a beautiful energy for anyone with a lot of “lone wolf” energy and likes their “alone time.” Again, as a 1/3 Projector, I enjoy my solitude and the ability to rest and recharge from others’ energies, so this connection seems perfect for my daily life.
In relationships with clients, I find that it is great in containers with monthly check-ins, so there is no day-to-day working together scenario. I feel like often, I do not even hear from the client until the time for our call, and we have a great chat and get lots done and lift each other up, and then go our separate ways until the next call. Perfect. 
There is just one more possible connection theme that Ra did not speak about in his lecture. I went through all the charts I have, and there was no one with whom I would form this connection. Hence I have no sample image to show, but let’s talk about what this theme is. 

6-3: 自由の方がいい
￼これらのテーマ名は、私の最初の夫と2番目の夫、そして娘のシャンテルとのつながりなので、とても面白いです。だから、私たちがお互いを嫌っているとか、つながっていないということではありません。私たちの間の絆は常に非常に強いものでしたが、お互いに十分なスペースを与えた方が関係はずっとうまくいきます。私は一日中1つの部屋で働き、夫は建物の反対側の別の部屋で働きました。私たちは夕方に会ってパーティーをしました！完璧です。
正しく入力すると、これは「一匹狼」のエネルギーが多く、「一人の時間」が好きな人にとってとても美しいエネルギーです。繰り返しますが、1/3プロジェクターとして、私は孤独を楽しんでおり、他の人のエネルギーから休息して充電できるので、このつながりは私の日常生活にぴったりのようです。
クライアントとの関係では、毎月のチェックインがあるコンテナで素晴らしいと思います。そのため、毎日一緒に働くシナリオはありません。よく、電話の時間になるまでクライアントから連絡が来ないような気がします。私たちは楽しくおしゃべりして、たくさんのことを成し遂げて、お互いを励まし合い、そして次の電話まで別々の道を歩みます。完璧です。
Ra が講義で話さなかった、もう 1 つ可能性のあるつながりのテーマがあります。私が持っているチャートをすべて確認しましたが、このつながりを形成できる人はいませんでした。そのため、サンプル画像はありませんが、このテーマについてお話ししましょう。


- 5-4: Not a Relationship Anymore
In this scenario, five centers are defined, and four are undefined. There is so much of “their own” here. Different interests, principles, values, and worldviews potentially – can be a recipe for disaster and conflict. And yet, if this relationship is correct, it has a great potential to feel most “alive” of all – on the premise that the opposites attract. And a potential to be complete in a completely different way than in a 9-0 theme.
It is a journey of exploration, discovering new sides to each other, never failing to surprise – provided that mutual understanding is established.

How can I use this information in my business? 
Let’s start with the fact that the most crucial condition to having aligned relationships with anyone is how we enter it. Do we follow our inner guidance, our strategy, and our Authority? Or does our Non-Self gets drawn to something for a non-self kind of reason?
AWARENESS is the word repeated here so many times, and it is the key word to what happens next.
Yesterday I had a note from a potential client enquiring about working together, and my Spleen immediately knew – this is a YES, ensuring that it is correct for me to follow up on this “invitation.” When I ran our connection chart, we were a 9-0- a potential to have great working relationships. But in her chart, I also see some strong Manifesting Generator busyness energies, and so I knew I needed to create very clear and healthy boundaries in the container I would offer to her, so our deep connection feels intimate and strong, but not like we cannot get away from each other. 
This sort of awareness makes a lot of decisions – what offer is best suited, in what format, and even at what price point very easy for me to make. And it also helps intentionally approach the relationships in a way that the connection theme determines. Understanding where to speak and where to allow freedom, where to create more intimacy, and where to create much more space. And this will all add to the experience and the transformation through working together. 
At the same time, it gives me a chance to watch for the red flags, and in some potentially conflicting situations, I can check with the specifics of the chart to see if there is something we can adjust, or perhaps just part, which is also an acceptable solution. At the end of it all, we are running our businesses to have a better life, not more stressful.  

5-4: もはや関係ではない
このシナリオでは、5 つのセンターが定義され、4 つは定義されていません。ここには「独自の」要素がたくさんあります。異なる関心、原則、価値観、世界観は、潜在的に災害や対立の原因となる可能性があります。それでも、この関係が正しい場合、反対のものが引き合うという前提で、最も「生きている」と感じられる可能性が非常に高くなります。そして、9-0 のテーマとはまったく異なる方法で完全になる可能性があります。
相互理解が確立されていれば、それは探索の旅であり、お互いの新しい側面を発見し、常に驚かされることになります。

この情報をビジネスにどのように活用できますか?
まず、誰とでも調和のとれた関係を築くための最も重要な条件は、どのように関係に入るかであるという事実から始めましょう。私たちは自分の内なる導き、戦略、権威に従っていますか? それとも、私たちの非自己は非自己的な理由で何かに惹かれますか?
ここで何度も繰り返されているのは「意識」という言葉であり、次に何が起こるかのキーワードです。昨日、潜在的なクライアントから一緒に仕事をしたいという連絡があり、私の脾臓はすぐに「はい」だとわかり、この「招待」に応じることが正しいと確信しました。私たちのつながりチャートを実行したとき、私たちは9-0で、素晴らしい仕事関係を築く可能性を示しました。しかし、彼女のチャートには、マニフェスティングジェネレーターの忙しいエネルギーもいくつか見られました。そのため、彼女に提供するコンテナに非常に明確で健全な境界を作成する必要があることがわかりました。そうすることで、私たちの深いつながりが親密で強いと感じられますが、お互いから離れられないような感じにはなりません。このような認識により、多くの決定が可能になります。どのオファーが最も適しているか、どのような形式か、さらにはどの価格帯かなど、私にとって非常に簡単に決定できます。また、つながりのテーマによって決まる方法で意図的に関係にアプローチするのにも役立ちます。どこで話し、どこで自由を許すか、どこでより親密さを生み出すか、どこでより多くのスペースを生み出すかを理解すること。そして、これらすべてが、一緒に働くことを通じての経験と変革に追加されます。同時に、危険信号に注意する機会も得られ、矛盾する可能性のある状況では、チャートの詳細を確認して、調整できる点があるかどうか、あるいは一部だけ変更できるかどうかを確認できます。これも受け入れられる解決策です。結局のところ、私たちはストレスを増やすためではなく、より良い生活を送るためにビジネスを運営しているのです。


# Compatibility by Human Design profile
￼
Finally, as we are talking about compatibility, we have to go back to my beloved personality profiles since these are the “roles we play in life.” There are three kinds of connections we can have: Resonant, Harmonious, and Dissonant
A resonant connection is when both people have the same profile. This means they think and experience life similarly, and they can develop a deep level of trust and security in relationships. I love my 1/3 clients and friends. I get them soo deeply, and I see in them all my gifts and my shadows sometimes. Like we know each other forever… The only minus is that the energy is too familiar. So in business, it really depends on what needs to happen. Do they need to be empowered in their own ways or challenged a little bit to charge up from a different way of seeing the world? That would be the question I ask myself as a coach before working with a person with my 1/3 profile.
Harmonious – are the profiles that complement each other well- while on different paths and seeing the world differently, they have the potential for growth and development together. The profile below is mechanically the most harmonious.

ヒューマンデザインプロファイルによる相性
￼最後に、相性について話しているときに、私の大好きな性格プロファイルに戻らなければなりません。これらは「人生で果たす役割」だからです。私たちが持つことのできるつながりには、共鳴、調和、不協和の3種類があります。共鳴するつながりとは、両者が同じプロファイルを持っていることです。これは、彼らが同じように人生を考え、経験し、関係において深いレベルの信頼と安心感を築くことができることを意味します。私は1/3のクライアントと友人が大好きです。彼らをとても深く理解しており、彼らの中に私の才能と影を見ることがあります。まるで永遠にお互いを知っているかのようです...唯一のマイナスは、エネルギーがあまりにも馴染み深いことです。したがって、ビジネスでは、何が起こる必要があるかによって本当に異なります。彼らは独自の方法で力を与える必要があるのか​​、それとも世界を異なる方法で見ることから充電するために少し挑戦する必要があるのか​​？それが、コーチとして私が1/3のプロファイルを持つ人と仕事をする前に自分に尋ねる質問です。調和的 – お互いをうまく補完するプロフィールです。異なる道を歩み、世界を異なる視点で見ていますが、一緒に成長し、発展する可能性があります。以下のプロフィールは、機械的に最も調和的です。

6/2 and 3/5
1/3 and 4/6
2/5 and 5/2
1/4 and 4/1
2/4 and 5/1
6/3 and 3/6

Dissonant – profile combinations where there is a potential for misunderstanding of each other’s lifepath. This can potentially lead to misunderstanding and even conflict. 
I have to stress, however, that it is far more important to judge each case individually. It is probably my line 3 talking, but we will not know just by looking at someone’s profile how it will FEEL to connect to them. And so I know that some of my best relationships are not listed under the harmonious ones. And those same profiles can also be on the charts of those people I had my worst relationships within business and in my personal life. 
 So I will leave you with this: awareness is crucial, but labeling based on one’s chart is unacceptable. Unless your inner guidance- your Authority is screaming HELL NO (I mean, it has to be saying Hell YEAH to show correctness), there is definitely an opportunity to explore, discover, learn and grow from every possible relationship. And this is what will help you choose who to work with and who to pass by – listen to your Authority, follow your Human Design Type Strategy and enjoy entering any relationships correctly, whatever they bring.
(Ra’s contemplations quotes were borrowed from A transcript of the Valentine’s Day Event by Ra Uru Hu on February 14, 2010)

不協和 – お互いの人生の道筋を誤解する可能性があるプロフィールの組み合わせ。これは誤解や衝突につながる可能性があります。
ただし、各ケースを個別に判断することがはるかに重要であることを強調する必要があります。これはおそらく私のライン 3 が話しているだけかもしれませんが、誰かのプロフィールを見ただけでは、その人とつながったときにどのような感じがするかはわかりません。そのため、私の最高の関係のいくつかは、調和のとれた関係の下にリストされていないことを知っています。そして、それらの同じプロフィールは、ビジネスや私生活で最悪の関係を持っていた人々のチャートにもある可能性があります。

したがって、次のことをお伝えします。認識は重要ですが、チャートに基づいてラベル付けすることは受け入れられません。あなたの内なるガイダンス、つまりあなたの権威が「絶対にダメ」と叫んでいない限り (つまり、正しさを示すために「絶対にイエス」と言わなければなりません)、あらゆる可能性のある関係から探索、発見、学習、成長する機会が確実にあります。そして、これが、誰と協力し、誰を無視するかを選択するのに役立ちます。権威に耳を傾け、ヒューマン デザイン タイプ戦略に従い、どんな関係であっても、それが何をもたらすにせよ、正しく関係に入ることを楽しんでください。
(Ra の熟考の引用は、2010 年 2 月 14 日の Ra Uru Hu によるバレンタインデー イベントの記録から借用しました)

# What your profile tells you about your love life

If you have a 1 in your profile…
… you want sturdy foundations in a relationship and you can secure them by taking your time to investigate and be curious about a potential partner before fully committing. You feel insecure if you don’t know enough, so take your time and exercise your natural caution and questioning to get to the bottom of things. You can be outgoing but selective, which comes across as restless or commitment-phobic to others. But underneath this is a deep need for stability, and once you find that person who you don’t want to lose, your commitment is total. 

If you have a 2 in your profile…
… you are someone who needs a lot of alone time. Be selective about who you date and be sure they understand and respect your need for solitude to do your own thing. Being in a relationship is easy for you; you’re an easygoing personality. Seek someone who reflects your unique magic and natural talents, which you may be oblivious to! Feedback helps you feel recognized, and it’s healthy to gain a sense of identity from the input of others. Because of your cooperative nature, be sure not to overgive or become submissive in relationships. Honor your need for focused hermit time. 

If you have a 3 in your profile…
… dating for you comes with ups and downs. Embrace that your life is a process of trial and error and trust that these are learning experiences here to help you grow. Don’t be afraid to move on when a relationship is no longer working, and take that growth and apply it to your next relationship. Experimentation is how you gain wisdom in this life, so don’t take failures and rejections so hard. You’re not designed to succeed in every romantic encounter. Take your time in getting involved, there’s no need to rush things. 

If you have a 4 in your profile…
… your opportunities come through your social networks, so you’ll have better luck meeting your person if introduced by mutual friends, or at a birthday party or work, than on a dating app. Dating strangers is not advisable; “friends first” is a better strategy for you. You have a warm heart and are a natural people person, but you can also be easily wounded by any slight or rejection and retreat to your ice palace in self-protection. The key is to be open and clear in your communication, including your expectations. Seek a partner you deeply trust, who honors your needs, and gives you lots of TLC. 

If you have a 5 in your profile…
… your charisma draws people in but be wary of others projecting onto you as you can serve as a mirror to them. Choose partners that see the real you, and keep revealing that to them instead of trying to impress them with your charm and idealized versions of yourself. You are a natural problem solver but be aware this can lead to codependent relationships where you’re always the fixer. Stay grounded in the dating process and seek a partner who will give you reality checks to help you move through life with your feet planted firmly on the ground. 

If you have a 6 in your profile…
… your first 30 years are meant to be a period of experimentation (much like having a 3 in your profile) and so it’s not advisable to commit to a life partnership until after 30, even though your desire for a soulmate is strong. Take your time to find a life partner that recognizes your deep wisdom; you operate at a higher level than most. This means you can come across as detached or aloof because of your lofty position. Select someone who supports your personal evolution and understands the journey you’re on — and is not intimidated by it. Trust is big for you.
