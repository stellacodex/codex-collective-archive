✅Personality
Your Personality
Conscious Manifestations of your psyche
On the right side of the Rave Chart are 13 Hexagrams (Gene Keys, Gates) whose energies influence your conscious behaviour. This is a psychological self-portrait of your Personality from the point of view of your mind.

Your mind uses these talents, skills, character traits and behaviours as inputs about itself and its capabilities. It can energetically "lean" on these activations - use them as sources of energy and put them into the mental concepts that you want to express to the world.

The Three Most Striking Qualities of the Self-portrait of your Personality
I strive to maintain a rhythm that is comfortable for me and a lifestyle I am accustomed to
I easily accept any changes in life and am able to initiate such changes myself
I seek to express my uniqueness through my appearance or my character
The Practical Value of this Knowledge
By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of your Personality, you can count exactly on your strengths. And vice versa - avoid negative conditioning where possible, and transform weaknesses into strengths. For example, by tracking transit weather or by selecting a person to interact with the appropriate Gate.

To correctly use this knowledge in practice - do not forget about the strategy of your Type. And delegate the right to make final decisions to your inner authority.

✅Design
Your Design
Unconscious manifestations of your psyche
On the left side of the Rave Chart are 13 Hexagrams (Gene Keys, Gates) that form the basis of your unconscious behaviour. As you do not always realize that you have these qualities, they are often simply ignored by you.

The energies of your Design leave your interlocutor with a unique energy "imprint" of your character. And your feelings from auric contact with another Design, on the contrary, remain in your cellular memory, as an impression formed about this person.

The three most striking qualities by which others judge you:
He is often immersed in his thoughts and is sure that he knows something more than the others do
He seeks to express his feelings to others in order to strengthen his social bonds
He has real wisdom and is able to deeply understand the essence of things or events
The practical value of this knowledge
When evaluating the actions, situations or deeds of those people with whom you interact, do not forget about the radiance of your aura in their eyes! People around you understand your Personality and listen to your mind. But they feel and remember your true Design much better.

Observe other people's reactions when you are around them and compare this to your knowledge of your Design. You will surely derive a lot of useful and valuable knowledge from this observation.

✅Not-Self
Your openness. "Not Self"
Places where your mind leans on stereotypes and beliefs
Your Opennesses are your Undefined Centres and the Gates and Channels missing from your Rave Chart. Here you are energetically vulnerable and open to conditioning. This is a chart of those places where you do not have your own fixed energy - they are highlighted in colour on the chart. In fact, this is a mirror inversion of your personal Rave Chart. Everything that is present in your Design / Personality, on the contrary, is not reflected here.

The Undefined Centres are always the focal point of your perception of the surrounding reality. Here your mechanics are aurically conditioned by other people who are attracted to your Opennesses. And you, like a magnet, are drawn to those who have activations that you do not have in your Rave Chart.

In addition, planetary transits periodically fill these areas with energy. All these influences make adjustments and additions to the workings of your mind. And the mind, in turn, is already able to transfer this influence to the algorithm of your consciousness and even affect your unconscious mechanics.
Lacking some natural attributes, your mind is always trying to get them. By wishful thinking, the mind can encourage you to act inefficiently and even do outright ridiculous things. Through the Undefined Centres, your mind will try to prove to yourself and others that you have a reliable energy foundation here, which in fact is not there.

By absorbing and amplifying someone else's energy, your mind begins to feel it as your own. As a result, you create a distorted sense of yourself - the so-called "not self". The "Not self" is a set of mental attitudes, beliefs or values ​​that were imposed on you by your parents, friends, society or the state. This does not mean that you will only download the incorrect programme here by default. Much will depend on your environment, your parents and the environment in which they raised you. The main thing is not to let the “not self” get the upper hand over your true nature.

By following your natural Strategy, you will gradually come to experience wisdom through your Opennesses. The wisdom of accepting others - without identifying with them. In general, any definition in the Rave Chart is a fixation on a topic, and any Openness gives you flexibility and sensitivity to other people's energies, gives you the opportunity to taste all the shades of these energies.

In fact, a lot here depends on your perception. You can consider your Undefined centers as a "weak link" - a place that definitely needs to be "power-levelled". And you can compare these Centres with school classrooms, in which we pass our most important life lessons.

⭐️ Mechanics
✅Type Mechanics
-----Who is the Manifestor?-----
9% of the Earth's total population
The Sacral Centre in the Manifestor’s Rave Chart is not defined, but one of the three remaining Motors centres - the Heart, Root or Solar Plexus - is defined and connected to the Throat by an active channel. This configuration of Centres and Channels in the Rave Chart makes your aura structure dense, repulsive and closed to others. It enhances your natural ability to influence others energetically through words or actions.

The purpose of all Manifestors is to initiate new processes and scenarios in society, giving the energy a starting impetus. Your initiatives are rarely ignored. No other Type is equally capable of effectively engaging others in the projects it is passionate about at the moment.

You are the one they follow and want to imitate. You are able to solve difficult problems alone. You like to be in the spotlight, emphasising your individuality and your desire for independence. Freedom of action is more important for the Manifestor than social stereotypes or other people's opinions. Any initiative implies proactivity and a willingness to act without request. So people with your Type's mechanics are quite self-sufficient, but at the same time quite wilful.

Often you lack the wisdom to direct the power of your influence in the right direction. Experimenting with living out your Design teaches courtesy and being more attentive to other people's expectations, naturally enhancing your ability to influence them.

-----Reasons for Resistance in Your Life-----
Attempts to act silently or manipulate others
Resistance in the Manifestor’s life can arise for two reasons. The first one being the Manifestor's lack of understanding of the power of their influence on people around him. The second one being attempts to exert undue pressure on other people or manipulate them for personal interests. When you act in silence, people around you feel confused. Your Manifestor’s aura forces them to unconsciously react to your initiatives.

But you are a “closed” book to people. They simply do not understand your goals and intentions, so they begin to create unnecessary resistance to you in the form of clarifying questions. The less often you inform others about your intentions, the more active will be their attempts to make you more predictable.

The Manifestor's inclination to unduly manipulate others or tell them what to do inevitably leads to even more resistance on their part. Those you are trying to pressure will seek to rein in your tactless and over-confident behaviour in any way possible. The tougher you act, the more people will reject you and your initiatives.

-----Negative Manifestations (The “Not-Self”)-----
Anger, rage, fury, irritability
The "Not - Self" is an emotional state or a physical sensation of a negative nature that arises every time you ignore your mechanics. Without warning others about your intentions, you predictably encounter resistance - and this angers and annoys you greatly.

When you feel like someone is trying to control your actions by telling you what to do or restricting your freedom to act, even with advice, you get angry and infuriated.

If you are resisted by a loved one– your anger will be openly vented at them, destroying your relationship. When dealing with strangers you will politely try to hide your feelings, but your repressed anger will continue to rage inside. Constantly holding back negative emotions can be detrimental to your physical and psychological well-being.

-----The Manifestor’s Strategy and the Secret of their Effectiveness-----
Inform about your intentions to perform any action
The Manifestor's strategy is surprisingly simple– just to inform about their intentions before initiating anything. This does not mean that you have to tell everyone about your plans or ask permission to carry them out.

Simply make your intentions known to those with whom you are in auric contact and who may be affected by your actions at the moment. And give advance warning of the forthcoming changes to those affected in the future.

Informing is the only way to remove unnecessary resistance and focus directly on the action you intend to take. Informing will allow you to clarify the situation, and for other people it will serve as a "window" into your intentions.

Those you initiate into your plans will involuntarily become your allies and may become involved in your process. If you tell others that you do not need help, they will not bother you and will not ask unnecessary questions that would annoy you with inappropriate curiosity. In this simple way, you can make way for yourself and your undertakings.

-----The Result that you will Receive as an Award-----
Increased influence, social harmony and inner peace
Once you start communicating your intentions, people will trust you more. Not only will they stop resisting your actions, but they will also be able to intuitively engage in your process by responding to it. You will begin to receive feedback on the power of your influence – directly from those affected. You will learn what is important and valuable for other people, understand their desires and dreams. You will see every nuance of your own energy and understand what worked well and what can be improved to make the most of your Manifestor’s talents.

By following your Strategy, you learn about yourself and get a powerful boost of energy for new actions. The sense of peace and security emanating from you will attract those who wish to assist you in spreading these frequencies. By acting through informing, you gain “freedom to manoeuvre.” This will allow you to show your full strength and find your long-awaited inner peace.

-----Life Lesson-----
Courtesy is the path to social freedom and greater influence
Courtesy – as an experience derived from one's own negative emotions resulting from an irresponsible attitude to the interests and energy of other people.

✅Inner Authority
Your Inner Authority is Emotional
Solar Plexus Centre Defined
The Inner Authority for the Manifestor, coupled with their Type Strategy, is the only correct way for them to make decisions about which processes to initiate and when to act. The Manifestor can have one of two kinds of Inner Authority – Emotional or Sacral.

How to Make Decisions?
Focus on the phase of the emotional wave. This means that it is necessary to "filter" the potential action at different levels of the emotional wave: in both sadness and joy, as well as at points in between. Ideally, this is the same direct question asked of you several times at different times.

The hallmark of a correct solution is clarity - when both at the top of the wave and at the bottom you feel the same response: “yes” or “no”. You feel confident that everything about this decision is right. If there is no clarity, keep filtering and wait until the decision is final: to act or not to act. No matter what point of the wave you are at.

If you have just started your experiment with Human Design, one hundred percent clarity may not be available to you yet. But the more diligently you learn to "filter" the wave, the more often you make decisions based on the feeling of correctness of what is happening, the faster you will be able to unlock the potential for absolute clarity. The potential unleashed by 100 per cent greatly increases the speed of decision-making: clarity can come already after the first response.

What Solutions Can It Be Used For?
In order to understand the extent to which, in principle, your initiative would be appropriate given all the circumstances.
To decide when it is best to take action.
To assess those you intend to involve in the process you have initiated.
To &quot;handle&quot; situations that require an unconventional approach or strong-willed solutions.
Possible Questions to Ask:
1. Did I have enough time to ‘filter’ my emotions?

2. Have I checked my decision both at the top and bottom of the emotional wave? And at other points?

3. Was I experiencing a gradual change in the response? And in the opposite direction?

4. Do I now feel that this decision is the right one?

5. Did I feel yesterday, the day before yesterday, a week ago that this decision was the right one?

6. Do I have any final expectations of the process?

✅Profile
Your Profile 5/1 (Heretic / Investigator)
People with this Profile - 14.27% of the population
Your Profile is the most transpersonal of all. This means that the focus of your attention is not on your own inner world, but on the growth and development of those around you. Your life mission is more about transforming the lives of others, and you can only fulfil yourself through correctly influencing them.

If your fulfilment of your Incarnation Cross brings happiness to someone, life will surely thank you. Paying attention to those around you, adjusted by your Type Strategy and Inner Authority, will return with a "boomerang" of goodness, abundance and new opportunities.

You are very thorough in nature and able to have a profound impact on others. One look at you, and they know they can trust you. And they are right. The advice you give is very practical and always works. Your ideas are incredibly contagious and attractive. The solutions you offer are versatile and unconventional.

You are a born leader. You are the one being asked for help. People see you as someone who can solve their problems and conflicts. And you are happy to take on the role of saviour or mentor. Helping and saving is your gift.

But only you alone know what lies behind such a "heroic" façade. Deep down, you often feel unsure of your ability to give what is wanted of you. You don't need to worry! In fact, being suspicious and even slightly "paranoid" about other people's expectations is perfectly normal for you. This is your defence against incorrect projections.

Learn to build personal boundaries and negotiate them - after all, others see you as a superhero and sometimes expect you to do things you are unable to do. By marking boundaries, you sober up their desires without allowing them to get a free ride.

It is very important for you to stand firmly on your feet and be fully confident in what you need to deal with - it could be people, projects, relationships. To gain this confidence, you need to "dig" the issue you are interested in down to the ground. To do this, you need time and privacy. By nature, you are a researcher. By getting to the bottom of things, you defeat your insecurity. The knowledge you gain helps you to gain strength and resilience.

✅Definition
Single Definition
People with such Definition - 39%
People with a single Definition have a holistic energy mechanics, because in their rave chart all defined Centers are interconnected into a single system. There is no gap between them - they are connected by at least one channel.

For such people, their consciousness is also integral. This means that you feel like a completely independent and self-sufficient person. You do not depend on others and feel great being alone.

Although you follow public opinion, you have your own point of view on everything. Your strength lies in the ability to resist external adverse influences. You are not very sociable and quite selective, so you do not have many really close friends - compared to people of other Definitions.

You are characterized by non-conformity - you boldly say what you think, and are not afraid of condemnation from others. In the worst case, a person with integral Determination can become an egoist who is indifferent to the interests of other people. But don't take it too negatively, it's your way of maintaining your identity.

✅What are Centers
What are Energy Centres?
The personal Rave Chart consists of several information layers, one of which is the layer of Energy Centres. An Energy Centre is a group of Gene Keys (Gates) whose energies have related properties and biologically correspond to a group of internal organs with similar functions in your body.

Nine Energy Centres regulate the flow of energy in your body, ensuring the integrity and efficiency of your psyche.

Each Energy Centre is unique in its own way. It expresses the energy of your self into the outer world, or vice versa, it takes on the energy of other people. Through the energy centers, an auric contact is established between you.

The physical presence of another person nearby stimulates certain mental functions and processes in your body. And your Design puts a unique energy imprint on the mood, thoughts and behaviour of other people. In the Human Design system, this kind of influence is called conditioning.

In the Rave Chart, the Energy Centres are represented as geometric figures that are highlighted in the appropriate colour or remain unshaded for those Centres that are Undefined in your energy mechanics.

The Centre is Defined (Closed)
Defined are Centres that are shaded in brown, yellow, green or blue in our version of the Rave Chart.
Such Centres reflect what will be invariably present in your life. Here you are energetically stable and protected from conditioning by others.
The energies of active Gates in a Defined Centre can have a strong influence on the behaviour, thoughts or mood of the people around you.

The Centre is Undefined (Open)
Undefined are Centres that are not connected to each other by an energy channel, but contain at least one active Gate.
Such Centres in the Rave Chart are not shaded and represent areas of your receptivity to the world.
It is here that the potential is laid for you to gain wisdom by being energetically conditioned and thereby learning something from other people.

✅Defined Centers
Your Defined Centres

Throat Centre
Manifestation of the inner self in words or actions.
You know when to speak and when to be silent, and you are equally comfortable with both. You have your own, constant and unique way of expressing yourself. If it is for you to speak, you are able to express your position or attitude to an issue in a clear and convincing way. However, be careful not to turn your oratory into a tool for psychological pressure

G Centre
Impersonal (transcendent) love and vector of movement through life.
You understand that it is possible to genuinely love not only another person, but also something inanimate, so you have your own stable preferences in every area of life - whether it be music, books, places to relax, etc. You have an innate sense of self-identity and are keenly aware of who you are, your place in life and which direction you should go next. You are able to share your values with someone who does not have the same clear life orientations. But first, make sure this person is on the same page as you.

Solar Plexus Centre
Emotional awareness. The depth of the feelings experienced.
You are constantly experiencing the full range of feelings and emotional experiences in the form of repeated waves and cycles. This can make it difficult for you to remain objective and in a stable mood for long periods of time. Try to control your emotions – especially in situations of acute conflict or crisis, so that you do not have to regret anything later.

✅Undefined Centers
Your undefined Centres

Head Centre
Pressure to think. The source of your inspiration and thoughts.
You draw inspiration for your thoughts from the outside world and from the people around you. You love the creative atmosphere and enjoy immersing yourself in it by attending various cultural events. But do not forget that excessive conditioning can confuse your consciousness and give you a headache at the body level.

Ajna Centre
Mental awareness. The type of thinking and information processing.
Your thinking is characterised by a flexible approach to fresh information and the ability to assimilate new knowledge well. The quality of perception depends not so much on you, as on the person sharing this knowledge with you. If your beliefs are based on information you have heard from someone else or from books, but are not based on your own experience, then you should not defend your views too vehemently.

Heart Centre (Ego)
A motor centre. Self-esteem, willpower, material interests.
You sense other people's willpower, level of self-esteem and ability to achieve material success. You know the real cost of things and the effort involved. But your own self-esteem is unstable, and it should not depend on someone else's opinion. Choose your social circle carefully - you reveal yourself where you are accepted as you are, not for any achievements. Your real value lies in your uniqueness! In order not to create unnecessary stress for yourself, you should not distribute promises to everyone and make unnecessary commitments.

Sacral Centre
A motor centre. The Generators’ creative energy source.
From the outside, you make the impression of a very energetic person, but you are not really distinguished by strength and endurance. The source of creative life energy for you is other people. In order not to undermine your health and maintain good physical fitness, try to be less fussy and not work too hard. Learn to calculate your forces correctly so that you can stop in time.

Spleen Centre
Instinctive awareness. Social adaptation, intuition, immunity.
You are a born diagnostician, able to read the physical condition of others. But your relationship with your own health is much more complicated. You do not have a built-in "beacon" to warn you of possible danger. Therefore, you are either afraid of everything in the world, obsessed with your health, or, on the contrary, you fearlessly take unjustified risks and cannot get rid of harmful habits. Learn not to make spontaneous decisions, especially in situations involving health and survival issues.

Root Centre
Pressure to act. Tolerance to stress and physical activity.
You do not tend to be physically active without an urgent need. But thinking about getting to work can make you feel a little nervous, even stressed. Try not to be overly relaxed, but do not panic if you are pressed for time. Learn to proceed at your own pace. Break up a large amount of work into several separate tasks. Then it will not seem so huge and depressing to you, allowing you to get out of procrastination.

✅ActiveChannels

12-22
The Channel of Openness
A Design of a Social Being
When your gift of Discernment (12) combines with the energy of Benevolence (22), you begin to feel a powerful energy that needs to be expressed to the outside world. But this energy will fully transmit your mood and your inner emotional background to others. You need to wait and love what you do - then your self-expression will mutate the other person. In this way, you will form new social ties correctly. This is not the main task or need, but a simple consequence of the channel energy expression.

10-20
The Channel of Awakening
A Design of Commitment to Higher Principles
When the energy of Self-Love (10) combines with the gift of Contemplation (20), your desire to express uniqueness through your appearance, behaviour or character is strengthened by awareness in the present moment. There is nothing more important to you in life than just being yourself. Your presence in the here and now moment enables you to follow the spiritual principles of existence through right action that is determined by accurate observation.

⭐️ Variables and PHS

✅Variables
PRR-DRR
Mind - Right, contemplative. Waiting for opportunities.
Your mind is a bottomless well of knowledge that can only be accessed by external enquiry. Self-motivation is not your strongest suit. External factors and other people motivate you much better.

Perspective - Right, waiting. Peripheral vision.
The survival perspective aims at waiting for the moment and passively observing what is happening. You have a philosophical outlook on life, so actively seeking out opportunities for self-fulfilment is not to your liking.

Brain and Body - Right. Receptive nervous system.
Right body that does not need constant physical activity. You should not overeat, it is good to move around less and have your meals in a proper environment that corresponds to your primary health system (PHS).

Environment - Right, passive. You need a relaxing environment.
Your living space should protect you from loss of energy and external stimuli. You feel more comfortable in an environment that helps relax your nervous system.

----Brief Report on the PRR - DRR Variable----
All the four Variables in your chart have the right, passive orientation. The first and most important step you can take towards your awareness is to follow your Type's strategy and delegate decision-making to your inner Authority.

A passive outlook on life and a contemplative mind endows your Personality with the outlook of a philosopher who is sometimes too irrational in his views. In self-development, you tend to wait for the right moment without actively seeking opportunities to improve your life.

The right brain is also receptive and passive. It is oriented at storing information and is not designed to create a logical structure. For such a brain to function properly, you just need to eat right. Physical activity brings little benefit to your body.

For holders of these Variables, the correct environment is one where they can feel comfortable, when they are relaxed. If they are in a place where they are constantly stimulated to be active or engaged in some physical activity, they may feel exhausted and lack energy.

-The Correct Motivation for Your Personality
Motivation:
Need
For someone with this motivation, the most important thing in life is having useful connections and contacts, so you are motivated by finding the right people. Depending on the direction of this Variable, which is determined by the Tone, you are motivated by the need to either share your knowledge and skills with them or, on the contrary, to get something useful from them. The false motivation for you is Fear, which makes you refuse to meet new people altogether, or you do so purely for fear of being left alone.

False Motivation:
Fear
When Need is replaced by Fear, one lives in opposition to one's nature. One acts not out of need to get something, but out of Fear of NOT getting it. In fact, it is impossible to even imagine how many Fears a person with the fourth Personality colour can live with when they are living life from the “Not-Self”. Influenced by distorted motivation, one seeks out new contacts and connections not out of a need to pass on a useful resource to them or receive it from them, but out of fear of being left alone.

✅Perspective on Life
Outlook on Life
Personalities Lunar Nodes

Right Perspective
Peripheral view of life. Passive observation of life, a sense of oneness with all that exists.

Color 6
Focus:

✅Body and Diet
Body and Nutrition
Design Sun/Earth

Right Brain
Passive, receptive. Right body that does not need constant physical activity.

Color 5
Dietary Type:
Listener (sound)
Basis of the dietary regime: The level of noise and acoustic vibrations in the surrounding environment when eating.
Eating circumstances:
Low sound environment
The minimum sound background contributes to better assimilation of food. Lunch in silence is not your cup of tea. Choose natural, simple and healthy foods.

Tone 4
Method of selecting dishes:
When choosing food, focus on your thoughts of food and visualise the foods you want to eat now.
Health Type:
Mental (ajna)
A decrease in the quality of vision and a deterioration in appearance in general indicate a deterioration in your health.
[text](https://www.humdes.com/en/tools/svg/e79bed36c3662afeac51b76756e03cbe/variables/brain/)

Report of the diet
Dietary Type:
Listener (sound)
You choose your own dishes and foods in your daily diet, however it is not the physical properties of food and other nourishing energies that are more important to you, but your interaction with your environment and different types of sound waves.

On the material plane, this is the sound background in which eating takes place. Important here are acoustically perceived environmental frequencies that influence personal health. On a mental level (thought process), this is an energy wave form and amplitude carried by images, ideas and other mental concepts.

The effectiveness of your absorption of emotions, as a type of energising energy, is also directly related to the frequency and amplitude of the sound (verbal) vibrations of the emotional flow.

Eating circumstances:
Low sound environment
Eating in absolute silence, or in presence of low sound vibrations would benefit your body the most. It maybe some background noise from the street or soft melodious music, but it should not irritate your hearing.

It is important for you to "hear" your body and its reaction to food, to hear whether you want to eat or not. On a mental level, the thoughts and mental concepts that are most useful to you are those that are 'smooth' and of a calm nature. These are smooth judgements and thoughtforms. The internal dialogue is quiet and calm.

The most beneficial effect on your nervous system will be those emotions and feelings that have a smooth structure. Optimal saturation of your body comes from the steady but powerful flow of the emotional current around you.

✅Environment
Design Lunar Nodes

Right Environment
Passive, relaxing. Your living space should protect you from losing energy.

Color 3
Living Environment:
Kitchens
Physical principle of environment: A space in which some kinds of energy or matter are transformed into other kinds of energy or matter.
Specifics of the living environment:
Dry kitchens
An environment that is focused on material processes and fire manipulation. It is more wholesome for you to live in a dry and hot climate.

Tone 5
The tone of the Lunar Nodes does not carry any specific programming for your Environment.
[text](https://www.humdes.com/en/tools/svg/e79bed36c3662afeac51b76756e03cbe/variables/habitat/)

Environment that is Right for your Body
Living Environment:
Kitchens
A living environment is a space with certain physical characteristics or properties that determine the dynamics, speed and strength of the propagation of the energies that fill that space, as well as the very nature of their origin.

The term 'kitchens' refers to a place where the processes of transforming one kind of energy into another take place. On a material level, it could indeed be a kitchen or some kind of production.

On a mental level, this is a debate or a dispute, where ideas and opinions may change during their expression. In the emotional space, this is an environment where emotions are constantly changing, and feelings are transformed into thoughts or physical sensations.

Specifics of the living environment:
Dry kitchens
Dry "kitchens" imply low humidity and low electrical conductivity of the environment. On the material plane, it can be any place where energy transformation occurs without the intervention of water or any wet substances - a computer classroom or a lecture auditorium or a training room.

On a mental level, it is the expression of formulas and patterns that are relevant to future times (plans, forecasts). Emotionally, these are "dry" or formal emotions that are purely positive, but more businesslike.

⭐️ Gates and Lines
✅Lines in the Chart
Each Hexagram consists of six lines. The line in the chart reflects the energy maturation stage of the hexagram (Gene Key/Gate). Each subsequent line carries the experience of the previous one. The lines are shown as behavioural aspects of the personality. The main ones are those that form the profile (the lines of the Sun and the Earth of the Personality-Design). The rest of the lines are a minor aspect of the character, but they also add a special colour to the overall picture. The number of certain lines determines the predisposition to the corresponding type of behaviour.

✅What are Gene Keys
The Gene Keys represent a living energy field. By receiving and comprehending information about them, step by step you will begin to be transformed through the chemistry of your thoughts.

And the more you fully you give yourself to it, the deeper knowledge will penetrate you.

There is a striking similarity between the structure of the human genetic code and the I-Ching hexagrams. There are 64 codons in our genetic code, just like there are 64 hexagrams in the I-Ching.

From a scientific point of view, each Gene Key can be associated with a specific neurotransmitter that inhibits or excites our nervous system.

Our body physically exists and works thanks to different proteins.

Proteins form the musculoskeletal frame of our body, skin and hair, organs of perception, internal organs, lymphatic, blood, immune and nervous systems.

The DNA molecule contains not only the “blueprints” for building future cells and living tissues, but also the algorithm for managing the entire process of protein synthesis in our body.

This is the fine programming of our nervous system and its synchronization with the rest of our body and sense organs.

Each Gene Key carries a specific energy that nurtures your individual abilities and talents, as well as influences your tribal or collective relationships.

These energies control the scenario of your personal evolution, and their frequency spectrum allows you to assess your degree of awareness and potential for growth.

✅Gates of Fears
Active Gates of Fear
Actively 7 Gates from 20
Our Physical fears related to survival, the World around, the forces of nature are so unpredictable, powerful! This disturbs our deepest fears that appeared and took hold at the genetic level in the most ancient times. All fears belong to the Energy Centres of Awareness, because they contain the potential to become aware of fear, thus transform it through acceptance. Initially, there is nothing wrong with being afraid. The only way to overcome your fear is that you have to go into it and find that its eyes are not that big!

The Splenic system is about our rationality to be afraid. Fear of survival creates alertness, which becomes awareness and keeps us alive. The anxieties are in the Ajna Centre. When you are in an anxious state for a long time, this is a sure sign that your Mind is fixated on some thought that does not give rest and resolution to the situation. Finally, the fears in the Solar Plexus Awareness Centre (Emotional Fears) manifest themselves in the theme of nervousness. Remember, fear is there until the Emotional Clarity arrives. Nervous fears come in waves.

17-Fear of challenge, fear of Inevitable, harsh or prolonged trials.
18-Fear of challenging legitimate authority or the unassailable authority of society.
22-Fear of lack of potential for growth, a tendency towards inferiority complexes.
28-Fear of mental or physical death, fear of not reaching the main goal in life.
44-Fear of the past, fear that negative events will happen again.
47-Fear of inevitable retribution for sins, fear of the power of one's archetype (God).
48-Fear of one's own or everyone's inadequacy that causes paranoia.

⭐️Wounds
✅Genetic Wound
Your Genetic Wound
❤️48.2-The Wound of Denial
The Wound of Denial is one of the most powerful. People with this Wound seem angry and aggressive, but in reality, they are very vulnerable. They are just afraid that others will not recognise their talents and thus hurt them. Often, they blatantly state that they do not care about other people's problems. And they hold this behaviour up as an example to others.

Defensive Reaction:
In the repressive form, it is a desire to deny one's own worth and the worth of others. In the reactive form, it is an angry reaction to any criticism that is difficult to contain within oneself.

Way of Healing: Relaxation/ Ease
By observing your denial in life, you will be able to transform this Wound. You can experience amazing ease and relaxation when you realise that there is no longer a need to defend yourself from the world, and that the world has absolutely no interest in hurting you in any way.

Try to be gentler with your loved ones! We all dip each other in wounds to eventually transform them and heal! Use the raised anger as fuel. You will be able to express your anger in a creative way, and it will soon turn into compassion for the whole world.

Emotional Reaction to the Manifestation of Wound
🩶5.1-Self-Sabotage
It is important to be honest with yourself about how you feel about yourself. Do not take the blame for the situation, go within and realise that there is nothing wrong with you.

At low frequencies, it manifests itself as a Shadow: Low Self-Esteem. An inner conviction that other people are better than you and there is something wrong with you.

At high frequencies, it turns into a Gift: Sustained Self-Esteem. Self-love combined with a willingness to surrender to life in all its manifestations.

Practical Guidelines for Working through Wound
Pay attention to why you are angry at other people. By observing your denial, you will begin to experience ease. When the Wound of Denial is transformed, you will be able to discover your talent for «heart marketing». It is an opportunity to reach out to the hearts of those your message, product or service is addressed to.

✅ Sexual Wound
Your Sexual Wound
🌙17.5　Fifth Line
Sexuality that attracts with its charm and allure
From Manipulative to Masterful

Gift:　Sensuality

Such a person has a sensuality that embraces not only them but also their loved ones. Their vulnerability and susceptibility become here not a weakness, but a strength that reveals attraction and sexuality. With these qualities and awareness such a person can easily make others fall in love with them, not only their partner, but also those around them who give in to their charms.

Shadow:Entrapment

If such a person starts to take everything to heart, the opinions of others can easily hurt their sensual nature and make them build a barrier between them and society. This choice leads to creating a new, more acceptable image, which, however, does not protect from pain and discomfort, but enables them to provoke others. Remember that you should not hide your own vulnerability behind manipulation — if you wear a "mask" for a long time, there is a chance of forgetting your own face.

Practical Guidelines:
Realise and accept your vulnerability and sensuality. These are not "flaws" that you need to get rid of, but your way of enjoying life. Leave the opinions of others to others and do not let them decide how you should live your life. Becoming comfortable for them, you lose your true essence and live someone else's life. Transformation begins with accepting who you are, even if someone does not like it.

What is Sexual Wound
The sexual wound is a way of getting to know a person in the context of an established pattern of behaviour in an intimate relationship. Richard Rudd, founder of the Gene Key teaching, identifies 6 types of sexual wounds. To determine the type of wound, you need to look at the Gate Line (the number after the dot) of the unconscious Moon (the red column). Each Line, in turn, has two possible expressions: Gift (high frequency) and Shadow (low frequency). The Gift is a Line's «true purpose», a quality that underpins your sex appeal and ignites interest towards you in the opposite sex. The Shadow is substitution, the «Not-Self», manifestations of repressed sexual energy and ways of 'protecting' oneself from excessively strong feelings.

In order to live in harmony with one's nature, one should not avoid the Shadows or get rid of them, but try to realise and accept them. Then they will strengthen your Gifts and take your life to a whole new level. It is the Shadows that point us in the direction of growth and help us learn from the past. They also teach us that real intimacy in a relationship occurs not between ideal people, but between those who have accepted the imperfection of themselves and their partner. Recognise your fears with your mind, accept them with your heart and be open to the other person - this is a simple algorithm for challenging work with truly worthwhile rewards.

⭐️ Hologenetics
✅Hologenetic Profile
What is a Hologenetic Profile?
The Hologenetic Profile is a chain of 11 Spheres that are divided into three Sequences and interconnected by Pathways. Each Sphere contains one Gene Key from your Rave Chart, activated by a specific celestial body.

By carefully studying these Sequences, you will be able to find answers to the three most important questions in the life of every person:

What is my Purpose and how can I fulfil it?
How to find harmony in relationships with people close to me?
How can I achieve success and prosperity in the material world?
The spheres follow each other in a certain order, connecting by means of the Pathways. The energy of the Gene Key in each Sphere is responsible for activating a specific area of your life. The Gene Key line (the number after the dot) specifies the mechanism, role or method that will help you switch its energy to a higher vibrational frequency.

The Pathways provide an opportunity to move to the next Sphere, using the energy of the previous one. They describe the actions that you need to perform in the process of Contemplation of the Gene Keys in these Spheres, or the situations that will happen to you in the process of transition between the Spheres.

As soon as you begin to work through the first Sequence, you will take the first step towards positive changes in your life. The intention expressed in this way attracts the right people for you into your life, gives you the necessary lessons and maintains the necessary dynamics for learning and growth.

✅What is the AS
The Activation Sequence
Relationship with Yourself
Working through this Sequence will help you fully fulfil your Purpose in Life. The main task of working with this Sequence is to lay a solid foundation for self-improvement of your Personality.

The Activation Sequence is calculated based on the astrological position of the Sun relative to the Earth at the time of your birth, and fixes in your energy mechanics the four Gene Keys that form your Incarnation Cross.

These Primary Gifts reflect your primary purpose and direction in life. They will lead you to an understanding of what you came into this world to do, they will suggest the way for the most effective development of your personality and the way to find inner stability.

All the four Spheres of the Activation Sequence are activated by pairs of Gene Keys, which are Programme Partners for each other. Each pair are two interdependent "triggers" whose operation is energetically synchronised, and their vibrations are always tuned to the same frequency.

As you pass through each Sphere, you will have a growing sense of self-confidence and the correctness of the changes that are happening to you. The results of passing through the rest of the Sequences will depend on the quality of the work done at this stage.

Venus Sequence
Relationships with the Loved Ones
The Venus Sequence aims to harmonise personal relationships through a willingness to open one's heart to Love. It consists of six Spheres and five Pathways.

The chart of this Sequence reveals the unconscious motives of your relationship with the world and yourself.

Working with the Venus Sequence will help you bring to the surface long-forgotten childhood traumas and resentments. Consider and heal them, transform them into strong personal qualities.

Old traumas will no longer interfere with your life, and relationships with the loved ones will qualitatively change for the better. New opportunities for more harmonious interaction with the family will be discovered.

Going through this Sequence will help you deal with your set of illusions, projections, and expectations about other people. It is important to remember that negative aspects in a relationship require special attention from you.

The Pathway of Love (or in other words, the Pathway of Isolation) connects the Sphere of Emotional Maturity (EQ) with the Sphere of Spiritual Development (SQ). Each time you manage to recognise and dismantle another low frequency pattern, the energy of true love is released from your DNA. The technique of overcoming this Pathway requires you to make Love the fundamental basis of all your actions towards your loved ones.
↓
The SQ Sphere determines the degree of openness of your heart. This is the courage to accept the drama of your life, while maintaining your inner light. This Sphere is located in the very core of the Venus Sequence and, in fact, is the energy centre of the entire Golden Path.

The Pathway of Realisation brings consciousness back to the point at which your physical incarnation began and fixes it on the high frequencies of unconditional love. This is the last Pathway of the Venus Sequence that connects the SQ Sphere of spiritual development with the Sphere of your Core. The Parhway of Realisation is very multifaceted and has many secrets, some of which are inaccessible to people's understanding. It serves as a guide to the core of your inner being, but is activated only when you heal your Genetic Trauma.
↓
The Sphere of your Core plunges you into the very core of your being - the source of all your suffering and the place of awakening of your limitless potential.

✅What is the PS
The Pearl Sequence
Relations with the material world.
This Sequence completes your Golden Path journey and puts your gains in self-understanding into practice. It harmonises your relationship with the world of material values.

The Pearl Sequence will help you understand how to properly interact with the world of material values. When your focus is on finding opportunities to survive and strengthen your position in society, you are often disconnected from your inner self.

The Pearl Sequence will help you strike a balance between the desire for material comfort and service to society. Steady presence in this role leads to the path of prosperity in the material world. You will be automatically rewarded with financial success.

The goal of going through the Pearl Sequence is not to start making more money. This Sequence will teach you how to properly present your talents to society and thus balance your desire for money with the recognition of your worth by others.

When working with the Pearl Sequence, like-minded people and allies will be attracted into your life, ready for effective cooperation. You will feel as if the whole world is trying to help you along the way.

↓
The Sphere of the Brand describes your inner style and frequency of expression that have a direct impact on your Prosperity. This Sphere is a synthesis of the energy of the first two Spheres of the Pearl Sequence - Vocation and Culture. It is at the top of your triangle of prosperity, and in this Sphere you reach the zenith of your life cycle.

Regardless of what it is you do in life, and what product you promote, at the highest level - you are the main product that you are able to offer this world. The Brand Sphere aligns the “product” with its “package” – your true essence and your unique style of expressing it to the outside world.

Sidhi: Timelessness
Gift: Patience

The Sphere of the Pearl

Gift: Simplicity
Shadow: Complexity

LINE 6. NATURE. The key to stabilizing the Pearl is for you to take care of the ecology and nature.
* The Pathway of Service
The Pathway of Service takes you back to the Sphere of your Core, but this time the focus shifts to higher topics. Here your genetic trauma turns into an ally and becomes your muse. But now you have to look at your wound as a like-minded person. And this will open up a window of opportunity for you to make a quantum leap in your development.
** The Pathway of Quantum
A Quantum Leap is a way to a new level of perception of reality. You begin to feel the rhythm of the Universe and no longer forget about what is really important in your life.

You should remember something about this mysterious pathway. When the energy is sealed on the outside by the three Spheres and Pathways, only one way for it to move is left, and that is to move inwards, into other dimensions. This is the Quantum Pathway. This Pathway has three variations, linking the Pearl simultaneously to each of the three previous Spheres.

Fulfilling your Vocation and talent in the right format and with the right motto (Brand) is the secret of switching the energy of the Gene Key in the Pearl to a higher frequency! And intelligent Initiative will open up new opportunities for your personal Growth.

The Pearl turns your awareness inwards and "crystallises" the very idea of Prosperity in your mind. It is only your willingness, with a truly open heart, to consciously direct this Growth to the Service of Society that will help you make the coveted “Quantum Leap”…

✅Light Field
Active Gates in the Field of Light
Here you are in a direct connection of the energy field of consciousness with the Upper Worlds, where your Consciousness connects with the source of True, Universal love. In the Field of Light, various perspectives of the Personality's spiritual development are presented. When you wake up, these themes will show up in your thoughts as ideas, intuitive insights, or creative inspiration. But this does not mean at all that the dreams that you experience in this Field will be lightful. They can carry a lot of darkness and be quite destructive for your Consciousness, appearing at low (shadow) frequencies.
8
Darkness
Emotions of sadness
Dreams that program the development of your Consciousness and your Spirit through patterns of dark energies and negative emotions.
8.1 — Secrets (Exploring the hidden essence of something that is already present in your real life.)

✅The Earth Plane
Active Gates on the Earth Plane level
The Earth Plan is connected with the fact that a part of the Earth's population is asleep, while the other part is awake. This dynamic occurs due to the rotation of planet Earth around its axis. When the neutrino streams pass through space, they transfer information from people who are awake to the bodies of those who are currently sleeping on the other side of the globe. If you have at least one active gate of the Earth Plan, then you have come to this world to receive information during your sleep about what is happening on the planet. In dreams received through this gate, you can see the problems of everyday life that you have now, have had in the past or will have in the future.

✅The Demon Realm
Active Gates on the Demon Realm Level
The gates associated with this plane reflect all the associations related to the dark side of your consciousness. This area of dreams reflects people's ideas about what the demonic world is. The mechanics with Gate activations in the Demon Realm is deeply vulnerable to fears. You may experience deeply disturbing dreams that may be associated with depressive states and inner feelings. If your DreamRave Chart has Demon Realm gate activations, then proper nutrition is very important for you, because food will directly condition your sleep.
