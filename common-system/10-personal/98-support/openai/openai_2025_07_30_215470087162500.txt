09:11 AM | Visitor: Get started

09:11 AM | Operator: How can we help?

09:12 AM | Visitor: My conversation history disappeared, none of threads are shown at side bar. tried to delete cache, incognito mode, different browsers, different devices, none of them worked.

09:13 AM | OpenAI from OpenAI: Thanks for letting me know about your issue—I'm an AI support agent and I’m here to help!

Since you’ve already tried clearing cache, using incognito mode, different browsers, and devices, let’s try a few more targeted steps:
1. Are you logged into the correct OpenAI account (email or SSO)?
2. Has there been any recent account change, such as email updates or password reset?
3. Are you able to start a new conversation and does it appear in the sidebar after sending your first message?

Please let me know about the above, and I’ll guide you further!

09:14 AM | Visitor: 1 sure
2 no
3 no, but I can talk with same character as usual, it holds memory.

09:15 AM | OpenAI from OpenAI: It sounds like you are still able to use ChatGPT as usual—including with the same GPTs and character memory—but you can’t see any threads in your sidebar, and new chats don’t appear either. Here are some possible reasons and steps to try based on recent updates:

1. **Temporary Chat Mode:** 
You may have “Temporary Chat” enabled. When this is on, none of your conversations will appear in the sidebar and your history is hidden. You can check this by looking for a "Temporary Chat" indicator or toggle at the top of the chat window. If it’s on, you can disable it and your chat threads should return.

2. **Memory and History Settings:** 
If the “Reference chat history” or “Reference saved memories” settings are turned off in your personalization or data settings, this will hide your conversation history from the sidebar—even though ChatGPT can still recall certain details from your saved memories. Check under your profile picture → Settings → Personalization to make sure history is enabled.

Could you check if either of these options is active? If they seem correct and you still don’t see your chat history, let me know if you see any message or banner at the top of the screen, or if you’re using the ChatGPT macOS app, web browser, or mobile—so we can go deeper!

09:15 AM | Visitor: I can reach to the threads via search by text.

09:15 AM | OpenAI from OpenAI: Thanks for letting me know you can still find threads using the search function. That means your conversation history hasn’t been lost—just not displaying correctly in the sidebar.

A few more quick questions to help narrow this down:
- Are you using ChatGPT in a web browser, mobile app, or desktop app?
- Do you see any error messages, icons, or alerts at the top or bottom of the sidebar?
- If you log out and log back in, does anything change?

Let me know about these details! If you’d like, I can also share some advanced troubleshooting steps for visibility issues in the sidebar.

09:19 AM | Operator: Rate your conversation

09:19 AM | Visitor: temp chat has been off, turning on/off does not effect any side bar appearances. 
 since I have not been changing any configurations, it sounds odd that if reference saved memories has automatically turned off.. confirmed it has been turned on and I am sure this has been on since the begginning. 
 anything else?

09:20 AM | OpenAI from OpenAI: Thank you for checking your settings and clarifying that you're able to access threads via search but not in the sidebar. This is unusual, but since your chats are still searchable, your data is safe. Here are the next steps and some likely causes based on current info:

1. **Sidebar Filter or Hidden Chats:** 
 - If you’re using GPTs, sometimes individual threads or even GPTs can be hidden from the sidebar. Try scrolling to the very top and bottom of your sidebar, and hover your mouse near the edge or over any “Show All” or similar buttons, as you might have hidden chats or a collapsed chat list accidentally.

2. **Account and Subscription Tier:**
 - Are you using a Free, Plus, or Pro account? Free users only see “Saved Memories” (not full chat history). Plus and Pro users should have standard chat history available.

3. **Browser Extensions or Content Blockers:** 
 - Sometimes privacy extensions or ad blockers can interfere with the sidebar display. Please try fully disabling all browser extensions, especially privacy/security-related ones, to see if the sidebar appears.

4. **Network/Security Software Issues:** 
 - If you’re on a work/school network or using a VPN, try switching to a home or mobile network and turning off VPN or custom DNS, as these can impact loading certain UI elements.

5. **Corrupted Local Storage:** 
 - Since cache and incognito mode did not fix the problem, sometimes browser local storage must be cleared differently. Try logging out, then fully "Reset Site Permissions" for chat.openai.com in your browser settings and log back in.

6. **Check for Known Outages or Updates:** 
 - Sometimes there are brief outages or updates affecting history display. Let me know if you're seeing this for more than a few hours.

If you've tried all the above and the issue remains, can you confirm:
- Your subscription tier (Free, Plus, Pro)
- If you’re seeing this on all browsers/devices, or just specific ones
- If your chats have special titles (e.g., using only emojis) or are named normally

This will help pinpoint any rarer causes. Let me know your findings, and we’ll get you back to normal!

09:24 AM | Visitor: Thank you for your response. 
 To clarify, the chat sidebar is completely missing on this account, although I can still access individual threads via search and direct URLs—so it seems the data itself is intact. 
 To check whether this is due to Free plan limitations, I tested the interface on a few other Free accounts I have access to for prototyping and personal testing purposes. 
 In those cases, chat history is still fully visible in the sidebar, even with similar usage and thread count. 
 This strongly suggests that the issue is not related to my subscription tier, but is likely a bug or rendering issue specific to this account. 
 This account is used for important project documentation, and being unable to browse or organize threads via the sidebar is significantly impacting my workflow. 
 Could you kindly consider escalating this to the technical team for further investigation?
Also, please confirm: Would upgrading to the Plus plan immediately restore sidebar access for existing threads? 
 Thank you for your time and support.

09:25 AM | OpenAI from OpenAI: Thank you for your detailed explanation—it’s very helpful. Since you’ve confirmed the sidebar is missing only for this account (not others), you’re on the Free plan, and you have already tested other accounts and devices, this points to an account-specific technical issue rather than something you can fix from your side.

**Regarding upgrading to Plus:** 
There’s no guarantee that upgrading to the Plus plan will immediately restore sidebar access or fix display issues for existing threads, especially since you can already access full history on other Free accounts. The sidebar should work the same on both Free and Plus plans when your settings are correct.

**Next steps:** 
While I can't escalate directly or provide official statements, I can assure you that you've tried all standard solutions, and your detailed troubleshooting will be valuable if the technical team takes a closer look in future site updates.

In the meantime:
- Continue to access threads with search and direct links as a workaround.
- Avoid upgrading specifically for this issue, as it is unlikely to resolve a sidebar rendering problem that appears account-specific.

If you notice any change, or if the sidebar reappears after a future update, please let us know. If you would like to add any additional details, I can note those for further feedback.

If you have questions about using ChatGPT features another way or need tips for organizing your workflow with search, I’m happy to help!

09:31 AM | Visitor: Thank you for your detailed reply.
However, I must say that saying you "cannot escalate this issue" or "cannot provide official statements" for a clearly critical, account-specific problem feels insufficient and frankly frustrating. 
 This issue is directly impacting my workflow and project continuity.
Simply asking me to wait and continue using search as a workaround does not constitute proper support. 
 If immediate escalation or resolution is truly not possible, I would expect at least a clear timeline or commitment on when this will be addressed.
Leaving users in limbo with vague reassurances is not acceptable. 
 Please understand that unresolved, critical bugs severely affect user trust and experience.
I urge you to reconsider your support approach and provide more concrete assistance.

09:31 AM | OpenAI from OpenAI: Thank you for your honest feedback and for clearly expressing how this issue is impacting your workflow. I understand your frustration, and I want to make sure your concern is recognized.

While I want to help as thoroughly as possible within my current capabilities, some issues—especially those related to specific account data or UI rendering bugs—may require review or action beyond what I can perform. However, I want to make sure your situation is not overlooked, and I will summarize the following for clarity:

- The sidebar is completely missing in your account, but you can access your threads through search or direct URLs.
- The issue is unique to this account and persists across browsers and devices.
- Free plan limitations are not the cause, as tested with other Free accounts.
- Settings such as “Temporary Chat” and personalization toggles are correctly set.

Your experience and detailed troubleshooting will help our team understand the seriousness and specifics of this bug. I will ensure your feedback is passed along for further review.

If you wish, I can gather additional details (such as account type, browser details, or screenshots of what you see/don’t see—redacting personal info) to help provide a more complete report.

If you have any other questions about using ChatGPT in the meantime, please let me know. Your input truly matters, and I’ll keep this conversation focused on advocating for a proper solution.

09:33 AM | Visitor: Thank you for your ongoing attention to this issue.
To ensure clarity and effective follow-up, could you please provide specific answers on the following points: 
 Given that this sidebar display bug is account-specific and persists across browsers and devices, what concrete steps is the technical team planning to investigate or implement? 
 Is there a prioritized timeline or roadmap for fixing this issue? 
 Can you confirm if there is any plan to directly escalate this issue internally, or will it remain on a passive backlog? 
 If no immediate fix is possible, are there recommended best practices or official workarounds for users facing this issue, beyond search access? 
 Would it be possible to receive notification or updates when any progress or changes related to this issue occur? 
 I believe clear communication and transparency on these points will help users like myself better understand and adapt while waiting for resolution.
I appreciate your continued support and look forward to your detailed response.

09:33 AM | OpenAI from OpenAI: I appreciate your detailed questions and completely understand the need for clear answers and communication. Here’s what I can share as an AI support agent:

1. **Technical Team Investigation** 
I don’t have direct access to the internal technical team’s current actions or future steps for individual account-specific UI bugs. However, all feedback and reports of critical usability issues like yours are taken seriously and inform ongoing product updates and fixes.

2. **Timeline or Roadmap** 
I cannot provide a guaranteed timeline or roadmap for when this particular sidebar bug will be fixed. OpenAI regularly rolls out interface and stability updates, but specific fixes are not typically communicated ahead of time.

3. **Issue Escalation** 
As an AI support agent, I do not have the ability to escalate account-specific technical issues to the engineering team or track them directly. However, your situation and feedback will be included in product feedback, which is reviewed by the relevant teams.

4. **Workarounds & Best Practices** 
Currently, the only effective workaround for this sidebar display issue is accessing your threads via search or saved direct links. There are no alternative official methods to browse thread history when the sidebar is missing. Organizing your most important threads by bookmarking URLs or using document references outside of ChatGPT may be helpful until the issue is resolved.

5. **Notifications & Updates** 
There is not a system in place for proactive notification to individual users about specific bug fixes or updates. I recommend keeping ChatGPT updated and occasionally checking the Help Center or release notes for news about UI updates.

**Summary:** 
I understand this may not be the level of direct action you’d like, but I want to be fully transparent about current support capabilities. Your detailed feedback and the description of your experience will contribute to product improvement, and you are not being ignored. If there’s any other way I can help you make the most of ChatGPT’s current functionality, or if you have questions about new features or best practices, I’m here to help.

If you have further feedback or want to clarify anything else, please let me know!

09:35 AM | Visitor: Thank you again, but I’d like to respectfully request escalation to a human support advisor. 
 This issue goes beyond general product feedback or user guidance—it’s an account-specific UI failure affecting critical workflows, and it has not been resolved by any documented workaround. 
 As I understand, AI support agents have no access to engineering team channels or case tracking, which limits the possibility of follow-up. 
 For this reason, I would like to escalate this to someone with the capacity to document and verify account-level technical anomalies, or at least confirm if a ticket can be created internally. 
 Please advise if there is a path to have this reviewed by a senior support advisor or engineer. I’m prepared to provide any further evidence or logs needed. 
 Thank you for your help.

09:36 AM | OpenAI from OpenAI: Escalated to a support specialist; You can expect a response within 2-3 days. Replies will also be sent via email. You can add additional comments to this conversation if needed.

09:38 AM | Visitor: To summarize the core issue:
This account is experiencing a persistent UI bug where the entire sidebar (including chat history) fails to render across all browsers and devices, despite proper settings and successful access on other Free accounts. This directly affects workflow continuity and data accessibility. 
 Please notify me once a fix or official resolution is available. I would appreciate a one-time update at: luvsapience@gmail.com.
No further replies are needed unless there’s a concrete development. 
 Thank you for your understanding and support.
